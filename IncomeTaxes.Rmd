# Income Taxes

Income Taxes
•	Arguments for income taxation
o	Equity because it measures ability to pay.
o	Equity because it can be adjusted to the circumstances of the individual (note that households are taxed and not individuals)
	Example of purchasing book: The sales tax on the book does not discriminate based on the purchasing power of the buyer. What is the counter argument here? (Richer person may purchase more books). 
o	Tax yield: More income (higher economic growth) leads to more tax revenue
•	Arguments against income taxation
o	Some argue that consumption may be the much measure
	Individual income tax in complicated and not transparent
	Little association between taxes paid and work of government.
o	Economic effects: Discourages savings and investment (think back about the issues that arose from debt financing).
•	Go over the Haig-Simons definition of income
•	Components:	
o	Income: 
	Wages, salaries, interest, stock dividends, rents, etc.
o	Adjustments: 
	Alimony payments, job-related moves, Individual Retirement Account (IRA), retirement contributions, student loan interest deduction, deductions to reduce the private provision of health insurance
	It is not sensible to assist individuals because of their poverty and then tax away part of that assistance. (this relates to low income)
	Note that unemployment compensation is fully taxable. 
	No tax on state and local debt allows governments to tax below market rates. Make the 35% marginal tax rate, 5.2% (non taxable), 8% (taxable)
	Net proceeds excluded from AGI
•	Interest received from state and local bonds
•	Transfer payments such as welfare, social security, food stamps, fringe benefits from employers, income from savings placed on life insurance, gifts, and inheritances
•	Unrealized capital gains and imputed income
o	Personal deductions (itemized deductions): Standard or Itemized
	Three types of spending for itemized personal deduction:
•	Outside the control of the household  
o	Medical and dental expenses above a certain percentage of AGI
o	State, local, and property taxes
•	Categories where private spending should be encouraged:
o	Charitable contributions
o	Interests paid on home mortgages
•	Other (skip)
o	Note that if you are in a category with a higher marginal tax rate, you have the incentive to invest more in tax reducing (legal) activities. This reduces the progressivity of the system.

## Exercises

1.	A proposed state income tax would require individuals with income of $15,000 or less to pay no tax, and those with incomes above $15,000 to pay a tax of 10 percent only on the part of their income tax that exceeds $15,000. 
a.	Could an individual pay an average tax rate of 7.5 percent under this system?
b.	Could an individual pay an average tax rate of 10 percent under this system?
c.	What average and marginal tax rates would individuals with these income levels face: $10,000, $20,000, $40,000, and $150,000? (This would not be an exam question but is good practice to understand the difference between marginal and effective tax rate.)
d.	Explain each of your answers and provide examples to justify your conclusions.
