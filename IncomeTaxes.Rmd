## Overview
There are three prominent tax bases: Income, consumption, and property. Whereas this chapter presents income taxation, the subsequent chapters cover consumption and property taxes. Note that those taxes are levied mostly at the state and local level since there is neither a sales nor a property tax at the federal level. Keep in mind that with respect to income taxes in the United States, households are taxed and not individuals.  

Let us first cover some arguments in favor of and income taxation. On one hand, the income taxation fulfills the tax evaluation criteria of equity since it measures ability to pay. The tax can also be adjusted to the circumstances of the individual household. In addition, the income tax is also adequate with regard to tax yield. That is, if households have increasing incomes (i.e., due to economic growth), government revenue increases as well. On the other hand, income taxation has some adverse economic effects since it discourages savings and investment of households since those returns are taxed. Some argue that there is also little association between income taxation and the good and services provided by the government. There is also the argument that the individual income tax is complicated and not very transparent. 

## Haig-Simons Definition
The Haig-Simons definition of income that it is equal to the value of consumption plus the change in net wealth during the year. This is similar to the economic definition of income as the sum of consumption and savings. Sometimes savings are referred to as net savings because the term can also be negative (i.e., representing a decrease in savings). 



	Example of purchasing book: The sales tax on the book does not discriminate based on the purchasing power of the buyer. What is the counter argument here? (Richer person may purchase more books). 

o	Some argue that consumption may be the much measure

## Components of 
•	Components:	
o	Income: 
	Wages, salaries, interest, stock dividends, rents, etc.
o	Adjustments: 
	Alimony payments, job-related moves, Individual Retirement Account (IRA), retirement contributions, student loan interest deduction, deductions to reduce the private provision of health insurance
	It is not sensible to assist individuals because of their poverty and then tax away part of that assistance. (this relates to low income)
	Note that unemployment compensation is fully taxable. 
	No tax on state and local debt allows governments to tax below market rates. Make the 35% marginal tax rate, 5.2% (non taxable), 8% (taxable)
	Net proceeds excluded from AGI
•	Interest received from state and local bonds
•	Transfer payments such as welfare, social security, food stamps, fringe benefits from employers, income from savings placed on life insurance, gifts, and inheritances
•	Unrealized capital gains and imputed income
o	Personal deductions (itemized deductions): Standard or Itemized
	Three types of spending for itemized personal deduction:
•	Outside the control of the household  
o	Medical and dental expenses above a certain percentage of AGI
o	State, local, and property taxes
•	Categories where private spending should be encouraged:
o	Charitable contributions
o	Interests paid on home mortgages
•	Other (skip)
o	Note that if you are in a category with a higher marginal tax rate, you have the incentive to invest more in tax reducing (legal) activities. This reduces the progressivity of the system.

## Exercises
1. ***Federal Income Tax Calculation*** (\*\*\*): Consider the following marginal tax table for a married couple

     |     Over |   Below | Tax Rate |
     |---------:|--------:|---------:|
     |        0 |  19,050 |      10% |
     |   19,051 |  77,400 |      12% |
     |   77,401 | 165,000 |      22% |
     |  165,001 | 315,000 |      24% |
     |  315,001 | 400,000 |      32% |
     |  400,001 | 600,000 |      35% |
     |  600,001 |         |      37% |


1. (\*\*\*) A proposed state income tax would require individuals with income of \$15,000 or less to pay no tax and those with incomes above \$15,000 to pay a tax of 10 percent only on the part of their income tax that exceeds $15,000. 
a.	Could an individual pay an average tax rate of 7.5 percent under this system?
b.	Could an individual pay an average tax rate of 10 percent under this system?
c.	What average and marginal tax rates would individuals with these income levels face: $10,000, $20,000, $40,000, and $150,000?
d.	Explain each of your answers and provide examples to justify your conclusions.

2. (\*\*) Dena is in the 10% federal income tax bracket and wants to invest $8,000 in interest-earning assets. Cullen is in the 35% bracket and wants to invest $15,000. The current rate on a typical high-quality tax-exempt municipal bond is 5% and on a similar quality corporate bond is 6.5%.
You are the financial adviser to both. Which investment would you recommend to each individual?

3. (***)

In class, we have seen that the personal exemptions are suspended until 2025. What I want you to do in this exercise is to compare the situation pre- and post- the new tax legislation. Do not worry about inflation for this exercise.
•	In 2017, the standard deduction was $12,700. The personal exemption was $4,050 per person.
•	In 2018, the standard deduction was $24,000. Personal exemptions were $0.

For both years, find the respective tax brackets for joint filings and compute the following:
1.	Adjusted gross income
2.	Taxable income
3.	Average tax rate
4.	Effective tax rate
5.	Marginal tax rate

In which year is the family better off? Please support your answers with numbers.
