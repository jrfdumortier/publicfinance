A large emphasize in the chapter is on the purpose of taxation and government intervention in the economy. Topics such as externalities, public goods, and imperfect competition are covered that all justify government’s role in the economy. Basics of Budget Preparation Budgeting in the United States: This chapter covers aspects of Federal, state, and local budgets specific to the United States. Budget Methods and Format Cost Analysis: To prepare a budget, institutions need to know the cost associated with service provision. This chapter covers cost accounting and estimation as well as cost allocation. Capital Budgeting: Purchasing assets that are used multiple years (e.g., bridges, public school buildings, infrastructure in general) require assessment of future cost and benefits, which are covered in this section. Introduction to Government Revenue: Compared to the previous chapters, which focus on the expenditure side of government activities, this chapter introduce the revenue side. General aspects of taxation such as equity, adequacy of revenue production, collectability, and economic effects are covered. Income Taxes: Individual and corporate income taxes Taxes on Goods and Services: Sales taxes, gasoline and diesel taxes, etc. Property Taxes: The majority of revenue for local governments to be spent on education or public safety comes from property taxes. Other Revenue Sources: There are also other revenue sources such as fees and state lotteries. Fees are for publicly provided services (e.g., driver’s license) Debt Management Revenue Forecasting and Estimation "],["role-of-government-in-the-economy.html", "2.2 Role of Government in the Economy", " 2.2 Role of Government in the Economy Public finance is concerned with the role of government in the economy. The field addresses questions such as the following: Why do governments intervene in the economy? How do governments intervene in the economy? What are the economic effects of government intervention? "],["exercises.html", "2.3 Exercises", " 2.3 Exercises Government Intervention (*): There are various reasons why governments intervene in the economy. Describe three reasons that justify government’s role in the economy. Each reason must include a definition of the concept and a discussion of why the government is required to address the identified problem. Businesses and Education (*): Private businesses have a great interest in quality primary and secondary education because today’s students are tomorrow’s employees. However, private businesses make limited financial contributions to this sector of education (excluding the taxes they pay to public school systems) even to market-oriented programs like vouchers and charter schools. What kind of good is primary and secondary education? Identify the characteristics of the good you identified in part (a) and explain how primary and secondary education satisfies these characteristics. Given your response to parts (a) and (b) above, does it surprise you that private firms contribute so little to primary and secondary education? Explain? Smoking (*): One rationale for imposing taxes on cigarette consumption is that smokers impose negative externalities on the rest of society for example through secondhand smoking. In the absence of taxation, will people tend to consume too much, too little, or the right amount of cigarettes? Public Good (*): A community project (a public good) will cost $2,500 and will benefit the five residents of the community as indicated in the table below. Answer the following question: Are the benefits of this project bigger than the costs? Would the project be approved by a majority at a referendum? Does the project meet the Pareto Criterion? Does the project meet the Kaldor-Hicks Criterion? Resident Individual Benefit Cost Share A 800 500 B 800 500 C 300 500 D 350 500 E 450 500 Total 2700 2500 Fishing (*): There are various indications that the fish population in some fisheries is declining (see for example Are cod ‘severely depleted’ in the Gulf of Maine? Why fishermen, scientists view ocean depths differently. To stop the depletion, fishing bans have been imposed in various regions globally (Frank et al., 2005). Explain the problem associated with fishing in the context of excludability and rivalry in consumption. Agency Budget I (***): This exercise involves learning to read and use information in public budgets. As part of this assignment you will be looking at a budget of an U.S. federal agency. First, pick an agency (do not pick a state) from A-Z index of U.S. government departments and agencies and make sure that the agency publishes a budget online. Download the budgeting information of the agency. Review the agency’s budget and answer the questions below. Note that every budget will not provide sufficient information to answer all of these questions. If the information is not available, you should note this in your answers. What is the mission of this agency? What are the major programs carried out by this agency? What is the percent increase in total requested expenditures for the next year over the last year’s budget? What object of expenditure category is the largest? Which is growing the fastest? Is the number of personnel (full-time equivalent also known as FTE) in the agency growing, and is the growth rate faster or slower than the personnel budget (in dollars)? What does this tell you about changes in average salaries? Real vs. Nominal Income (*): Assume that your income in year 1 is $200 and that the prices of raspberries and orange juice are $20 and $10, respectively. In year 2, the prices of raspberries and orange juice are $22 and $11, respectively. Assume that you fully exhausted your income in both years to purchase raspberries and orange juice and that you purchase the same quantities of those items in both years. Did your income increase if you earned $210 in year 2? Distinguish between real and nominal income. How much money do you need to earn in year 2 to have the same real income in both years?

Item 2002 2017 Total Actual (in Billion $) 13.818 15.734 GDP Implicit Price Deflator (2010 = 100) 84.33 112.32 Answer the following questions: Compute the percentage change in FAA’s budget in nominal dollars from 2002 to 2017. Compute the annual compound growth rate of the FAA’s budget in nominal dollars from 2002 to 2017. Compute the percentage change in prices from 2002 to 2017. Compute the annual compound growth rate in prices from 2002 to 2017. Compute the percentage change in FAA’s budget in real 2017 dollars from 2002 to 2017. Compute the annual compound growth rate of the FAA’s budget in real 2017 dollars from 2002 to 2017. Real and Nominal Federal Budget (***): The U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB) publishes historical budget tables. For this exercise, consider the following two tables: Table 1.1: Summary of Receipts, Outlays, and Surpluses or Deficits Table 3.1: Outlays by Superfunction and Function Prepare an analysis in both nominal and real dollars (2018 $) of the following data for 1975-2023: (a) Total federal outlays, (b) total defense spending, and (c) total spending on Medicare and Medicaid Agency Budget II (***): In this exercise, you are assigned an agency of the U.S. federal government. You will determine whether the expenditure (as a share of total federal expenditures) for your agency have increased, decreased, or stayed the same over the time period covered in the data. Ignore the years that are estimated. Also, if you have “on-budget” and “off-budget” for your agency, combine the values. Please use basic Excel functions to make the calculations easy for you. You will prepare a table with the following columns to be include in the exercise submission: Year GDP Deflator: Go to webpage Federal Reserve Economic Data and search for “Gross Domestic Product: Implicit Price Deflator” which will lead you to access data about the GDP Deflator. Note that the default setting is “quarterly” but that you need annual data. Click on “Edit Graph” and change the frequency to “Annual.” Download the data and paste it into the column. Nominal Federal Outlays: In this column, you paste the expenditure from the federal government. Nominal Department Outlays: Real Federal Outlays: Based on the GDP Deflator, calculate the outlays of the federal government in real terms. Real Department Outlays: Based on the GDP Deflator, calculate the outlays of your department in real terms. Annual Growth Rate for Federal Outlays: Calculate the year-to-year change in expenditure for the federal government. Annual Growth Rate for Department Outlays: Calculate the year-to-year change in expenditure for your department. Share of Department Outlays: Determine whether the outlays (as a share of total outlays) for your assigned department of the U.S. federal government have increased, decreased, or stayed the same over the time period covered in the table "],["budgeting-in-the-united-states.html", "4 Budgeting in the United States", " 4 Budgeting in the United States There is a YouTube video and slides associated with this chapter: Budgeting in the United States: Video and Slides "],["exercises-2.html", "4.1 Exercises", " 4.1 Exercises Agency Budget III (**): Use the following federal agencies for this exercise: Fish and Wildlife Service, Forest Service, Bureau of Land Management, Bureau of Reclamation, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, U.S. Geological Survey, Army Corps of Engineers, Environmental Protection Agency, and U.S. Coast Guard. You will be able to locate the answers in the Budget of the United States Government, available through the OMB website. Determine where each agency lies in the administrative structure of the federal government. Is it in an executive department or is it an independent agency? Determine which of the appropriation subcommittees has jurisdiction over each agency’s budget request. Determine where each agency’s operations fall in the functional classification of the budget. Pick one agency and, for a recent budget year, determine (1) the budget authority and outlays proposed for the agency, and (2) the actual outlays and budget authority for the agency in that year. Federal Budget Deficit (***): Read the August 2018 report from the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) which is titled The Deficit Reductions Necessary to Meet Various Targets for Federal Debt. Note that the table of content indicates a “Summary” which contains most of the answers to the following questions: What is the difference between constant-share scenarios and growing-share scenarios? What are the effects on income per person (Gross National Product or GNP per person in the report) from reducing the deficit under various scenarios? Reducing the federal deficit can be accomplished by either increasing taxes or decreasing spending. What do you think are some of the economic, demographic, and political difficulties that arise while deciding which deficit-reducing policy to implement? How has the COVID-19 pandemic and its associated change in the economic and fiscal environment changed the projections outlined in the report. Mandatory versus Discretionary Spending (*): Why does only about 30% of all federal spending go through the annual appropriation process? Has that always been the case or were there periods where more than 30% of spending needed to go through appropriation? If yes, why has it changed over time? State Budgets (**): Pick a state of your choice (not Indiana) and identify key elements (listed below) of your state’s budget process and budget. The National Association of State Budget Officers (NASBO) provides much of this information in its publication Budget Processes in the States. Does your state have an annual or biennial budget? Which functions does the budget agency execute in your state? E.g, economic analysis, audits? What veto power, if any, does the governor have? How many votes does it take to override the governor’s veto? Is the state’s budget easily accessible on a state run website? Access the most recent (proposed) budget document and identify, to the extent possible, what policy priorities are identified in the report. Terminology (*): Explain the difference between rescission, sequestration, impoundment, and deferrals? Antideficiency Act (*): The Antideficiency Act of 1870 states “that it shall not be lawful for any department of the government to expend in any one fiscal year any sum in excess of appropriations made by Congress for that fiscal year, or to involve the government in any contract for the future payment of money in excess of such appropriations.” Explain why the federal government can run a budget deficit despite the language in the Antideficieny Act?
