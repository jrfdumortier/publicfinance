Introduction and role of government in the economy: This part serves as an introduction to government finance and budgets. The topics covered in this chapter are (1) the size of federal expenditures (outlays) and revenue and (2) the role of government in the economy. A large emphasize of the chapter is on the purpose of taxation and government intervention in the economy. Topics such as externalities, public goods, and imperfect competition (commonly referred to as market failures) are covered that all justify (to a certain degree) government’s role in the economy. It also covers economic stabilization and redistribution as reasons for government interventino. To better understand this and the remaining chapter(s), you should watch the video Monetary Values over Time, which covers real and nominal prices. Basics of Budget Preparation: The focus of this chapter is on recurrent budgets that cover current year expenditures with current year revenue. A recurrent budget is different from a capital budgeting, which is covered later in the book. The goal of a recurrent budget is to ensure that the government’s income matches its spending and thus, promotes fiscal responsibility. We cover the budgeting process, which typically involves a cycle that includes budget preparation, review, approval, and execution. This ensures that each phase is planned and scrutinized before implementation, allowing for effective management of public funds. Budgeting in the United States: This chapter covers aspects of Federal, state, and local budgets specific to the United States. In the federal budgeting process, several important elements come into play. Institutions, audits, and evaluations are critical for ensuring transparency and accountability throughout the process. Appropriation bills are required for discretionary spending, which funds specific programs and services. Meanwhile, mandatory spending, such as Social Security and Medicare, does not require appropriation bills, as it is governed by existing laws. Budget Methods and Format: Budget methods and formats vary depending on the needs of the government or institution. Budgets are often classified by categories such as functions, programs, or departments. Cost analysis is essential to ensure that resources are used efficiently and that decisions are based on a thorough understanding of the financial impact. The budget format typically includes examples and breakdowns to show how funds are allocated across different areas, ensuring clarity in the decision-making process. Cost Analysis: To prepare a budget, institutions need to know the cost associated with service provision. This chapter covers cost accounting and estimation as well as cost allocation. Capital Budgeting: Purchasing assets that are used multiple years (e.g., bridges, public school buildings, infrastructure in general) require assessment of future cost and benefits, which are covered in this chapter. The characteristics of capital assets is that (1) their useful life is more than one year, (2) the expenditure is non-recurring, (3) the expenditure is usually very large (e.g., infrastructure projects such as bridges or airports). - Usually very large expenditure Government Revenue: Compared to the previous chapters, which focus on the expenditure side of government activities, this chapter introduce the revenue side. General aspects of taxation such as equity, adequacy of revenue generation, the ability to collect revenue, and economic effects are covered. The various revenue generating activities presented are income taxes (i.e., taxes on individual and corporate incomes), taxes on goods and services (e.g., sales tax, fuel tax), property taxes, and other revenue sources (e.g., driver’s license fees, state lotteries). Property taxes represent the majority of revenue for local governments and are spent locally on on education or public safety. At the state and local level, governments rely on three main sources of revenue: taxes, federal aid, and borrowing. These sources enable them to fund services and infrastructure projects. Debt management and forecasting: At the federal level, it is important to distinguish between a deficit or surplus and debt. A deficit occurs when the government’s outlays in a given fiscal year exceed its revenues, while a surplus arises when revenues exceed expenditures. In contrast, debt refers to the total amount of money the government owes, accumulated over years of deficits. A key aspect of borrowing involves bonds. When a government or entity issues a bond, it commits to paying the bondholder regular interest and repaying the principal at a future date, known as the maturity date. There are various types of bonds, and their values fluctuate based on interest rates, market demand, and the creditworthiness of the issuer. Deficit and debt management involve strategies to handle both short-term fiscal imbalances and long-term accumulated debt. This ensures that governments can meet their financial obligations while maintaining economic stability. "],["data-sources.html", "1.2 Data Sources", " 1.2 Data Sources The intention of this book is to provide up-to-date data with each iteration. The book also places a very high importance of data credibility and only information from reputable sources are used. The focus is on objective and unbiased data from the original source. The following presents some of those data sources. Congressional Budget Office (CBO): The CBO is associated with the legislative branch and publishes reports on a plethora of budgetary topics such as the CBO Long Term Budget Analysis or the cost of the Coast Guard’s Polar Security Cutter. Of course, the long-term budget analysis is of great interest to stakeholders since it quantifies federal revenues and expenditures given current policies and macroeconomic projections. Those projections may not always be accurate but can serve a guidance for policy making. For example, in the 2002 CBO Projections (January 2002) The Budget and Economic Outlook: Fiscal Years 2003-2012, the projected debt held by the public as a percentage of GDP in 2012 was estimated to be 7.4%, which was 69.4% in reality (Source). Significant discrepancy between projection and reality can occur due to policy changes and unforeseen shocks such as tax cuts, homeland security, 2001 economic downturn, 2008 great recession, stimulus spending (all in the 2000’s), or COVID-19. Office of Management and Budget (OMB): Many data series associated with the federal budget are obtained from the White House’s OMB. Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED): A data source extensively used throughout this book is the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) of the St. Louis Fed. The above mentioned data series regarding the debt held by the public as a percentage of GDP is obtained from FRED. An additional data source for U.S. data is the U.S. Census Bureau. International organizations such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank, or the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) provide data for all countries on important economic indicators. For example, data on general government gross debt as a percentage of GDP is provided by the IMF. The OECD compares the tax revenue as a percent of GDP among member nations. For the European Union (EU), the main data source is EUROSTAT. The following are two examples: General government deficit/surplus General government gross debt "],["introduction.html", "2 Introduction", " 2 Introduction This chapter serves as an introduction to budgeting and public finance. We quantify the size of the U.S. government relative to its economy as well as give an international perspective.

The Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) defines GDP as follows: The value of the goods and services produced in the United States is the gross domestic product. Economic growth is measured by changes in the GDP and is an important macroeconomic indicator. GDP growth (or lack thereof) serves as an important indicator for recession dating besides employment levels. The National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) announced the following by its Business Cycle Dating Committee on January 7, 2008: We view real GDP as the single best measure of aggregate economic activity. In determining whether a recession has occurred and in identifying the approximate dates of the peak and the trough, we therefore place considerable weight on the estimates of real GDP issued by the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) of the U.S. Department of Commerce. Let us next present some broad numbers illustrating the size of the U.S. government in terms of expenditures (also called outlays) and revenue. Those numbers are taken from the CBO’s Federal Budget 2022. There are two broad categories of outlays. Discretionary outlays (e.g., defense) go through the annual appropriation process. As opposed to the discretionary outlays, mandatory outlays (e.g., Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid) do not go through the appropriation process. The total government revenue in 2022 was $4.9 trillion from the following, broad sources: Individual income taxes ($2.6 trillion) Payroll taxes such as Social Security ($1.5 trillion) Corporate income taxes ($425 billion) Other revenues such as excise taxes, estate and gift taxes, customs duties Government expenditures (outlays) amounted to $6.3 trillion in the following categories: Mandatory spending ($4.1 trillion) Discretionary spending ($1.7 trillion) Net interest ($475 billion) Note the difference (deficit) between the expenditures and revenue of about $1.4 trillion. Below are the federal net outlays and receipts in real terms, that is, adjusted for inflation. Although the previous graph suggested a significant increase in outlays and revenue, the size of the U.S. government as a percentage of GDP has been relatively stable over time given the Federal Receipts as Percent of Gross Domestic Product, Federal Net Outlays as Percent of Gross Domestic Product, and Federal Surplus or Deficit as Percent of Gross Domestic Product. Given the deficit and associated debt, which needs to be financed, there is often a discussion regarding which countries hold how much U.S. debt. For January 2023, the Major Foreign Holders of Treasury Securities (in billion USD) were the following countries: Top 10 Countries Jan-23 GDP Ratio Japan $1,104 $4,231 26.1% China $859 $17,963 4.8% UK $668 $3,071 21.8% Belgium $331 $579 57.2% Luxembourg $318 $82 387.8% Switzerland $291 $ 808 36.0% Cayman Islands $285 Canada $254 $2,140 11.9% Ireland $253 $529 47.8% Taiwan $235 "],["state-and-local-government.html", "2.2 State and Local Government", " 2.2 State and Local Government Besides the federal government, there is a large number of local governments in the United States.

Some taxes only exist at certain levels of government while other can exist at multiple levels. For example, there are fuel taxes at the federal and state-level and sometimes even at the local level. Below is an example of the real tax revenue for Indiana. "],["international-perspective.html", "2.3 International Perspective", " 2.3 International Perspective "],["efficiency.html", "2.4 Efficiency", " 2.4 Efficiency The term “efficiency” is often used in economics and public finance. In economics, it refers to the allocation of resources such that overall welfare to society is maximized. In the context of public finance, let us focus for now on Pareto or Kaldor-Hicks efficiency. Pareto efficiency is achieved when no person can be made better off without another person being made worse off. Since this is very restrictive, the Kaldor-Hicks efficiency offers a less stringent alternative. Under Kaldor-Hicks efficiency improvement, there is a positive net benefit to society such that winners could—at least theoretical—compensate the losers after a policy change. Although Kaldor-Hick efficiency is usually the basis for a cost-benefit analysis, the drawback is that the compensation is potential and may never be realized. Consider the table with the individual benefits and costs associated with a single project. Individual Resident Individual Benefit Cost Share Individual Gain A $3,500 $2,000 $1,500 B $1,000 $2,000 ($1,000) C $1,500 $2,000 ($500) D $4,500 $2,000 $2,500 E $1,500 $2,000 ($500) Total Benefit $12,000 $10,000 $2,000 The project is Kaldor-Hicks efficient because the total benefit ($12,000) exceeds the total cost ($10,000). However, the project is not Pareto efficient because the costs exceed the benefits for some people. This project would also not pass a majority vote. "],["role-of-government-in-the-economy.html", "2.5 Role of Government in the Economy", " 2.5 Role of Government in the Economy Public finance is concerned with the role of government in the economy. The field addresses questions such as the following: Why and how do governments intervene in the economy? What are the economic effects of government intervention? Before the next sections cover the answers to those question, we cover the difference between positive and normative economics. Positive economics is the objective analysis of economic outcomes (e.g., the effect of increasing interest rates on the number of mortgage applications). Normative economics includes value judgements of what should be done (e.g., evaluation of various policies to increase education spending to make society better off). Positive economics can inform normative economics. Of course, the boundaries between both concepts are not always clear cut because even positive economics may include some value judgement given the assumptions made. In public finance and public management economics, we often need to make value judgements in an attempt to make society better off. Below, we are covering three reasons why governments intervene in the economy: Market failures Economic stabilization Redistribution 2.5.1 Market Failures The First Theorem of Welfare Economics can be considered the theoretical basis for the intervention of government in the economy: If (1) households and firms act perfectly competitively, taking prices as given, (2) there is a full set of markets, and (3) there is perfect information, then a competitive equilibrium is efficient. The implications of the First Welfare Theorem are that Pareto efficiency can be achieved in a competitive market. A competitive market is usually the benchmark to judge actual market outcomes. The First Welfare Theorem requires the absence of market imperfections such as (1) public goods, (2) externalities, (3) imperfect competition, and (4) asymmetric information. Note that the term “public” refers to a characteristic of a good and not the provider. Some characteristics of a perfectly competitive market are that (1) there are many producers and many consumers, (2) free entry and exit into the market exists, and (3) market participants are engaging in price-taking behavior. The price-taking behavior is a direct result of many producers and many consumers. That is, each market participant is aware that no matter what quantity of the product they supply or demand at the individual level, the price does not change. Market imperfections and failures exist and lead to an inefficient allocation of societal resources. Public Goods: As mentioned before, “public” is a reference to characteristics and not the provider of the good. The distinction between various types of goods (e.g., public good versus private good) can be conducted along two dimensions: Rivalry: Overall consumption of the good is affected by individual consumption. Excludability: Ability (or lack thereof) to exclude people from consuming the good. Consider the following table to distinguish four types of goods along those two dimensions. Rival Non-Rival Excludable Private good Club good Non-Excludable Common good Public good Here are some examples of the various types of goods Private goods: Sandwiches, laptops, etc. Club goods (also known as toll goods): Movies in theaters, toll roads, concerts, etc. Common goods (also known as common pool resources): Aquifers, fishing grounds, petroleum reserves, etc. Public goods: National defense, mosquito abatement, pollution control, disease control, lighthouses, GPS, etc. Club goods and public goods are under-produced and common goods are over-consumed. The marginal (additional) cost to provide a public good to one more person is zero. Externalities: An externality is a positive or negative effect resulting from a person’s (or entity’s) action without them receiving any compensation or incurring any cost. The distinction is made between a positive and negative externality: Positive externality: Production of uncompensated benefits received by others (e.g., landscaping, beekeeping, university, research and development). Goods that generate a positive externality are under-produced. Negative externality: Production of uncompensated cost borne by others (e.g., Gulf of Mexico Hypoxic Zone, cigarettes). Goods that generate a negative externality are over-produced. We can examine the history of firefighting to see how a negative externality led to the development of public fire services. A century back, homes purchased (or not) fire insurance from companies. The house was then marked with a mark showing the insurance company. If a house was on fire, the fire services sent had to match the insurance company. That is, if your uninsured neighbor’s house was burning, fire services would not arrive for them. There are also pecuniary externalities, which are the result of actions by market participants having an effect on market prices. For example, a sudden increase in home purchases increases the market price making it more expensive for other consumers. But it is also more profitable for homeowners selling and under complete markets, there is a net zero effect. Hence, pecuniary externalities are not considered (from an economic perspective) problematic. Imperfect Competition: The requirements of the First Welfare Theorem regarding perfect competition are many producers and many consumers, free entry and exit into the market, and price-taking behavior. Market structures for which those conditions are violated suffer from an efficiency loss. Those market structures are either a monopoly (one producer) or oligopoly (small number of producers). Market inefficiencies also exist when the number of consumers is small or singular. In that case, the terms oligopsony and monopsony are used. Underproduction of goods occurs in the context of imperfect competition. Other Market Failures: Two other types of market failures are asymmetric information and adverse selection. Asymmetric information refers to a situation in which one party in an interaction (e.g., contract, transaction) has more or better information than the other party. The most common example is the purchase of a used car. In this case, the seller has more information than the buyer. The buyer having more information of the seller can also occur for example in the case of obtaining health insurance. Adverse selection leads to market participation based on asymmetric information (e.g., skydivers purchasing more insurance, bad drivers choosing a lower deductible). Moral hazard refers to a change in risk engagement due to presence of insurance. For example, the presence of (subsidized) flood insurance may decrease the hesitation to move to a flood prone area. The premium for federal flood insurance is about 38% of what it should be in a competitive market. Two following motivations of governments to intervene in the economy are covered in the next sections: Economic stabilization: Insuring economic growth as well as preventing high unemployment and inflation Redistribution: Transfer payments to ensure a minimum standard of living for all members of society 2.5.2 Economic Stabilization A critical function of the government is to stabilize the economy and ensure a low and stable inflation rate as well as low unemployment rate. There are two types of interventions: Monetary policy: Monetary policy such as setting the interest rate is conducted by the central bank. Fiscal policy: Fiscal policy—which is one aspect of this book—includes determining taxes and expenditures. It includes the redistribution of income through transfer payments from one entity to another, such as social security or unemployment benefits. Fiscal policy also involves levying taxes on income, corporate profits, and specific items like tobacco and alcohol. These so-called “sin” taxes are designed to alter consumption patterns and reduce the consumption of products resulting in negative externalities. No matter what policy intervention is chosen, there is usually a time lag between implementation and policy effects. 2.5.3 Redistribution The General Social Survey (GSS) in 2022 asked the following question: We are faced with many problems in this country, none of which can be solved easily or inexpensively. I’m going to name some of these problems, and for each one I’d like you to name some of these problems, and for each one I’d like you to tell me whether you think we’re spending too much money on it, too little money, or about the right amount. Are we spending too much, too little, or about the right amount on welfare? Respondent were split on the question with answers of “too little” (34.2%), “about right” (34.7%), and “too much” (31.1%). However the range of answers indicate that some redistribution is desired. In a market economy, income is distributed to individuals based on their ownership of valuable resources, such as property, skills, and land. However, this distribution is often unequal, as not everyone has equal access to these resources. This creates a motivation for redistribution, driven by both social conscience and the fear of social disorder. Societies may feel a moral obligation to support those with fewer resources, and there is also a practical concern that extreme inequality could lead to instability. To address these issues, governments implement income redistribution policies to improve the standard of living for low-income individuals and households. This is typically achieved through progressive taxes, where those with higher incomes pay a larger percentage of their earnings, and through transfer programs that provide financial assistance to those in need. These measures aim to create a more equitable society by reducing the disparities in income and wealth. "],["methods-of-government-intervention.html", "2.6 Methods of Government Intervention", " 2.6 Methods of Government Intervention As mentioned before, monetary and fiscal policy are the broad categories of how governments can intervene in the economy. Governments also play a significant role in the provision and production of goods and services, particularly through infrastructure investments that require funding from taxes. These projects are essential for public welfare but often necessitate substantial financial resources, leading to the collection of taxes to support government initiatives. Government influence extends to private production as well. This influence is exerted through regulation, as well as through subsidization or taxation of private production to guide economic behavior. Additionally, governments purchase goods and services from the private sector, further impacting the market. We are going to differentiate between provision and production of goods and services. Provision refers to the responsibility of ensuring that a service is available to the public, often involving funding or regulation by the government. Production refers to the actual creation or delivery of that service, which can be done by either the government itself or by private entities. The production and provision of goods and services is undertaken by three main sectors: private, public, and nonprofit. A central question arises regarding who will provide certain goods and services, particularly those whose societal benefits exceed the costs of production but might not be provided by the market. This leads to considerations about whether these goods and services should be produced by the public or private sector. Public provision and public production are seen in entities such as local school districts, state police departments, the Federal Emergency Management Administration (FEMA), and the Bureau of Motor Vehicles. These services are funded and operated by government agencies to meet public needs. In some cases, there is private provision but public production. For example, private entities may provide services like police control at rock concerts, commercial satellites launched by NASA, and fee-based services at state parks. Here, private organizations offer the service, but the government handles the production aspect. Conversely, there is public provision but private production, such as with private prisons, charter and voucher schools, private military contractors, and most weapon systems. In these scenarios, the government funds or mandates the service, but private companies are responsible for production. Finally, there is private provision and private production, exemplified by private schools and the Indiana Toll Road. In these cases, both the provision and production of goods and services are handled entirely by the private sector, often driven by market demand rather than public funding or government mandates. Examples in this category are Indiana toll roads. An important question relates to the economic effects of government intervention. Economic theory shows that efficiency can be (re-)established after correcting market failures. An example would be a Pigouvian tax for a negative externality or a price ceiling for a monopoly. There is also the question of equity versus efficiency, i.e., protection of certain groups may outweigh efficiency from a political perspective. Of course, there is always the issue of interaction between policies. For example, there is a federal subsidy on electric vehicles but state registration fees on electric vehicles.

Describe three reasons that justify government’s role in the economy. Each reason must include a definition of the concept and a discussion of why the government is required to address the identified problem. Businesses and Education (*): Private businesses have a great interest in quality primary and secondary education because today’s students are tomorrow’s employees. However, private businesses make limited financial contributions to this sector of education (excluding the taxes they pay to public school systems) even to market-oriented programs like vouchers and charter schools. What kind of good is primary and secondary education? Identify the characteristics of the good you identified in part (a) and explain how primary and secondary education satisfies these characteristics. Given your response to parts (a) and (b) above, does it surprise you that private firms contribute so little to primary and secondary education? Explain? Smoking (*): One rationale for imposing taxes on cigarette consumption is that smokers impose negative externalities on the rest of society for example through secondhand smoking. In the absence of taxation, will people tend to consume too much, too little, or the right amount of cigarettes? Public Good (*): A community project (a public good) will cost $2,500 and will benefit the five residents of the community as indicated in the table below. Answer the following question: Are the benefits of this project bigger than the costs? Would the project be approved by a majority at a referendum? Does the project meet the Pareto Criterion? Does the project meet the Kaldor-Hicks Criterion?

Why fishermen, scientists view ocean depths differently. To stop the depletion, fishing bans have been imposed in various regions globally (Frank et al., 2005). Explain the problem associated with fishing in the context of excludability and rivalry in consumption. Agency Budget I (***): This exercise involves learning to read and use information in public budgets. As part of this assignment you will be looking at a budget of an U.S. federal agency. First, pick an agency (do not pick a state) from A-Z index of U.S. government departments and agencies and make sure that the agency publishes a budget online. Download the budgeting information of the agency. Review the agency’s budget and answer the questions below. Note that every budget will not provide sufficient information to answer all of these questions. If the information is not available, you should note this in your answers. What is the mission of this agency? What are the major programs carried out by this agency? What is the percent increase in total requested expenditures for the next year over the last year’s budget? What object of expenditure category is the largest? Which is growing the fastest? Is the number of personnel (full-time equivalent also known as FTE) in the agency growing, and is the growth rate faster or slower than the personnel budget (in dollars)? What does this tell you about changes in average salaries? What information does this budget give you on the productivity and performance of this agency? What information would you like to have to be able to assess the ‘efficiency’ and ‘effectiveness’ of this agency? Real vs. Nominal Income (*): Assume that your income in year 1 is $200 and that the prices of raspberries and orange juice are $20 and $10, respectively. In year 2, the prices of raspberries and orange juice are $22 and $11, respectively. Assume that you fully exhausted your income in both years to purchase raspberries and orange juice and that you purchase the same quantities of those items in both years. Did your income increase if you earned $210 in year 2? Distinguish between real and nominal income. How much money do you need to earn in year 2 to have the same real income in both years? "],["basics-of-budget-preparation.html", "3 Basics of Budget Preparation", " 3 Basics of Budget Preparation There is a YouTube video and slides associated with this chapter: Basics of Budget Preparation: Video and Slides Government Accounting: Slides This chapter covers the basics of budgets such as the budget function, budget purpose, and budget preparation. It also introduces governmental funds and governmental accounting. For now, the focus is on so-called recurrent budgets as opposed to capital budgets. Recurrent budgets finance current expenditures with current revenues. Capital budgets—which are covered in a later chapter—finance large expenditures with a multi-year lifespan with future tax revenues (e.g., debt financing) due to fairness issues. Before we start introducing budget basics, consider your personnel budget, which may help think about the budget aspects of the government. You may have a planned allocation of money to various categories such as housing, food, apparel, or health care. You also have various (competing) considerations regarding allocation based on your martial status, number of children, expected income, and so on. You may also have rainy day funds available and you make a distinction between routine expenditures (e.g., food) and long-term investments (e.g., car). In any case, your personnel financial situation is likely improved due to presence of budget. Note though that the spending activity of a government results in different economic outcomes, which are covered in later sections, than your personnel budget. Budgeting is the process of developing, implementing, and evaluating a budget. The political scientist Aaron Wildavsky (1930-1993) stated the following: The budget is the lifeblood of the government, the financial reflection of what the government does or intends to do. The crucial aspect of budgeting is whose preferences are to prevail in disputes about which activities are to be carried on and to what degree, in the light of limited resources. A budget is a plan to allocate public resources and there is no policy without a budget. It serves as a decision guide for the provision of governmental goods and services. The spending in various categories and the revenue collection also reflect policy choices made by the government. There are many budget aspects to consider such as the types and extent of goods and services provided, the size of the government relative to the private sector, the relative size of departments and agencies within the government, or the methods to raise revenue. On a historical side note, the focus of initial budgets was theft prevention. Budgets drive public policy with multiple and often conflicting objectives (e.g., empty reservoir for flood control versus full reservoir for recreation). There is also no standard measure of objectives. For example measuring a reduction in traffic fatalities is much simpler than gains from cleaner rivers. Consider two examples that fullfil multiple objectives: Subsidizing school lunches both feed children and creates income support. Needle exchanges for drug users reduce the public health risk of HIV infections as well as lifetime treatment cost, which is estimated to be around $379,668.). Place-based versus people-based resource allocation Simple treatments of abandoned buildings and vacant lots returned conservative estimates of between $5.00 and $26.00 in net benefits to taxpayers and between $79.00 and $333.00 to society at large, for every dollar invested (Source: New Yorker “The other side of broken windows”) Implications for the budgeting process Participatory Confrontational Compromising Forecasts are the basis for budget development even if those forecasts change over the lifetime of the budget. For example, it is important to know the effect of economic growth on tax revenue and expenditures in terms of transfer payments for unemployment insurance. Another example would be a snowfall forecast and plan (with the necessary budget) by the Department of Transportation. Different response plans and/or policies based on identical forecasts lead to different budgets. It is also important to differentiate budgets and political rhetoric. Consider the following sentence: For education, I maintain our commitment from last year and note that my budget includes direct educational grants to cities and towns of $2,026,000,000. Although the sentence is factually correct, inflation and/or additional students my potentially decrease the level of services. "],["budget-function-and-purpose.html", "3.1 Budget Function and Purpose", " 3.1 Budget Function and Purpose There are four budget functions, which we are going to cover in this section: Financial plan: Financial resource allocation to government programs, projects, and services Operations guide: Specification of activities to achieve policy goals and measures of performance Policy document: Setting of policy priorities by allocating more resources to areas that are considered higher-priority Communication device: Budget as a tool for transparency and accountability to taxpayers First, the budget outlines the financial implications of governance given the anticipated operating environment. It specifies how revenues will be raised and how those resources will be distributed across various functions (e.g., government programs, projects, and services). The budget projects expected revenues and expenditures over the budget period and limits expenditures to the resources available to ensure solvency. In case that a difference between revenues and expenditures occurs, it outlines steps for remediation. Additionally, the budget reinforces fiscal discipline by controlling expenditures and assigning responsibility for resources to ensure funds are used for their intended purposes. This increases transparency and prevents corruption, which is one of the main reasons for the creation of budgets in the first place. It also provides legal authorization for the government to spend money on specific programs. Second, as an operations guide, it outlines how public services will be delivered efficiently and cost-effectively. It provides a detailed description of the activities, services, and functions performed by different organizational units, specifying personnel requirements and performance goals for agencies, units, and programs. Importantly, it ensures that all government activities align with legislative intent and conform to legal restrictions regarding the raising and expenditure of funds. This operational function of the budget also serves as a mechanism for ensuring transparency in fiscal operations. Third, a budget sets priorities through the allocation of resources and thus, acts as a policy document. It articulates long-term, non-financial goals and objectives, presents and evaluates alternatives to achieve these objectives, and identifies long-term financial challenges. The budget allows policymakers to specify priorities by directing more resources toward higher-priority areas, thus reflecting the government’s policy agenda. Finally, the budget serves as a communication device, facilitating discussions among policymakers, informing stakeholders of priorities and policy directions, and ensuring transparency for citizens. This communicative role fosters accountability by keeping taxpayers informed about government activities and the rationale behind financial decisions, making it an essential tool for transparent governance. Given the function as a communication device with stakeholders, it is important to systematically structure the information provided in a budget. The budget can be structured around administrative units (e.g., agencies) who provide services such as fire department, schools, or police. An alternative way of presenting the information is around economic items (i.e., types of expenditure) such as wages, salaries, or utility charges. And lastly, budgets can be structured functionally around the purpose of expenditure (e.g., education, health, defense). Recall that at the beginning of this section, we talked about your personnel budget. Similar to your personnel, it is recommend to be prudent in budgeting and account for unexpected events such as economic downturn. Thus, there should be a budget stabilization fund (also known as a rainy day fund) and it is recommended to under-estimate revenues and over-estimate expenditures. "],["budget-preparation.html", "3.2 Budget Preparation", " 3.2 Budget Preparation A latter section covers the Federal budget preparation and cycle and here, we are going to focus on a generic government budget preparation. The public budget cycle usually involves four steps, which form a recurring and overlapping process between legislative and executive branches: Executive preparation Legislative review and approval Budget implementation Audit and evaluation Executive Preparation: The executive preparation starts with forecasting the economic climate and projecting revenue and expenditure. It guides decisions and outlines responses to those decisions. For example, the Department of Transportation uses snowfall forecasts and sets priorities which roads to clear first. This process includes a budget call to agencies and departments which outlines executive priorities, limits on the expenditure growth based on revenue forecasts, and detailed instructions for budget preparation. Agencies prepare and submit their budgets in response to public service demands, and the executive budget ultimately serves as a message of policy direction. Legislative Review and Approval: The legislative review and approval process involves aligning legislative priorities and constituency interests within appropriation limits. This includes making recommendations, conducting hearings, and reconciling any differences through modifications before adopting the final appropriation bills. Following this, the executive may veto the budget, to which the legislature can respond with further actions to address the veto. Budget Implementation and Audit and Evaluation: Budget implementation involves the execution of public programs by agencies using appropriated funds, ensuring legal spending in accordance with the budget while avoiding deficit spending. This phase focuses on the practical delivery of services. After the fiscal year ends, audits and evaluations are conducted, including financial audits to verify legal spending, management audits to assess agency performance, and program audits to evaluate the effectiveness of the programs. An external review of budget execution is conducted, with findings reported to both the legislature and the public. 3.2.1 Budget Document Budget documents include the following components: Budget year: Budget plan for current year Out years: Budget plan beyond the current year Progress report year: Tracking and comparison of actual expenditures and revenue to budget Final report year: Previous year’s budget and outcome The budget message at the beginning of the budget document outlines the goals, objectives, key challenges, and constraints. Given the mention of constraints, it should also contain strategies to address those challenges. The budget message also highlights initiatives to promote goals and objectives. The budget document also includes information about the economic climate, policy priorities, circumstances, constraints, and key changes compared to previous years. Summary tables should include revenue and expenditure trends (by function and object) and workforce trends as well as explain major budget drivers. 3.2.2 Detailed Departmental Budgets Break-down of budget by unit Organization chart Mission, objectives, achievements Budget summary Detailed line item budget Personnel detail Program/sub-unit specific budgets 3.2.3 Budget Examples Example of biennial budget Indiana budget Current budget: 2023–2025 Budget Example of an annual budget Indianapolis Federal Aviation Administration "],["exercises-1.html", "3.3 Exercises", " 3.3 Exercises FAA Budget (**): The following table contains information on the budget of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the GDP deflator.

It is also possible to have one department and multiple functions. For example, the DOD is responsible for national security and natural resources and environment (given the large area of land occupied by military bases).

The main executive branch office is the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), which was mentioned previously as a major data source. Legislative branch offices (i.e., those reporting to Congress) are the following: Congressional Budget Office (CBO), Government Accountability Office (GAO), and Congressional Research Service (CRS). Let us present those institution in more detail: Office of Management and Budget (OMB): The OMB is responsible for the construction of the President’s budget. It is (1) setting the funding priorities, (2) evaluates the effectiveness of agency programs, policies, and procedures, and (3) assess competing funding demands among agencies. The OMB submits the President’s annual budget and supporting materials to Congress. It supervises and coordinates the administration’s procurement, financial management, information, and regulatory policies. The OMB is also tasked with improving the administrative management and developing performance measures. And lastly, it ensures consistency of agency reports, rules, testimony, and proposed legislation with the President’s budget and administration policies and priorities. Congressional Budget Office (CBO): The CBO provides nonpartisan budgetary information and analyses to Congress and its committees. In addition, it is tasked with the following: Annual five-year economic forecast Review of President’s annual budget submission Budget baseline projections Preparation of financial reports Evaluation of spending and revenue options for reducing budget deficit "],["key-federal-budget-laws.html", "4.3 Key Federal Budget Laws", " 4.3 Key Federal Budget Laws There are some key laws associated with federal budgeting in the United States. Before we present those key laws, let us present some terminology used: Impoundment refers to the decision of the President to withdraw funds. Rescission is the proposal by the President to withdraw funds. It requires a majority vote of approval by Congress within 45 days. Deferrals are “…temporary delays in the release of funds for obligation.” The maximum delay is until the end of the fiscal year. Like the rescission, a deferral requires approval by Congress as well. More information on rescissions and deferrals can be found in Judicial Review of Rescissions and Deferrals Under the Impoundment Control Act. Constitution (Article 1, Section 9): No Money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in consequence of appropriations made by law; and a regular statement and account of the receipts and expenditures of all public money shall be published from time to time. Anti-Deficiency Act (earliest version 1870): The Anti-Deficiency Act prohibits departments to spend more than appropriated by Congress. Budget and Accounting Act of 1921: The Budget and Accounting Act of 1921 created the Bureau of Budget (which is now called OMB) and the GAO. It set the start of the fiscal year to July 1 (which is now October 1). In addition, it established a national budget system and independent audits of government accounts. Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974: The Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974 established budget committees in both the House and Senate,as well as created the Congressional Budget Office (CBO). These committees and the CBO were tasked with enhancing the legislative branch’s ability to analyze, oversee, and manage federal fiscal policies. The Act required the President’s budget to include a functional classification, which we have mentioned previously, to organize federal spending by purpose (e.g., defense, education, healthcare). The Act also replaced the practice of impoundment—where the President could withhold spending of funds appropriated by Congress—with rescission and deferral. Finally, the Act shifted the start of the fiscal year from July 1 to October 1. Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act: Also known as Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 established deficit targets to balance the federal budget by 1991. The mechansim to meet the target was called sequestration (“cancellation of budgetary resources”). It triggers automatic spending cuts if total discretionary appropriations exceed budget spending thresholds. It affects all departments and programs by an equal percentage. The original version was ruled unconstitutional by the Supreme Court because it violates the Constitution’s command that Congress play no direct role in the execution of the laws. Budget Enforcement Act (BEA): The BEA was part of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990. It is a replacement of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1987 (previous version from 1985) and establishes upper limits on discretionary spending. The Act expired in 2002. The BEA institutionalized so-called (pay-as-you-go) PAYGO rules as a way to manage the federal deficit by requiring offsets for any new spending or tax cuts, making it a central part of fiscal discipline in the 1990s. PAYGO requires that any new legislation affecting mandatory spending or tax revenue must not increase the federal deficit. Specifically, if Congress enacts a law that either increases entitlement spending or decreases revenues (such as through tax cuts), the cost must be offset by either cuts to other mandatory spending programs or by increases in revenue (e.g., through tax hikes). This means that any new spending initiatives or tax reductions must be “paid for” to ensure fiscal discipline and prevent adding to the national debt. Put differently, it required policy changes to be deficit-neutral or deficit-reducing. Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010 (“PAYGO”) Prevention of new tax cuts or entitlement spending legislation from increasing deficits Budget Control Act of 2011 Reintroduction of discretionary spending limits with sequestration Balanced budget amendment Bipartisan Budget Acts of 2013 and 2015 Relaxation of upper limits imposed by Budget Control Act 2011 due to excessive restrictiveness "],["federal-budget-cycle.html", "4.4 Federal Budget Cycle", " 4.4 Federal Budget Cycle The federal budget cycle follows a structured timetable beginning with the submission of the President’s budget no later than the first Monday in February. Six weeks later, the Congressional budget committees report their budget estimates. Key dates in the process include April 15, by which Congress must complete its budget resolution, and May 15, when the House begins considering appropriations bills. By June 15, reconciliation should be completed, and the House is expected to finalize appropriations by June 30. On July 15, the President submits a mid-session budget review, and the fiscal year officially starts on October 1. 4.4.1 President’s Budget Request The President’s budget request is developed by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) based on submissions from federal agencies. It begins with an outline of the President’s overall fiscal policies, detailing expected spending, tax revenues, and projections of deficits or surplus spending. The budget also provides an outline of the President’s priorities for federal programs over the next five years, highlighting areas such as defense, agriculture, and education. Additionally, it includes recommendations for changes in spending and tax policies to align with the administration’s goals. More information can be found: More information: U.S. Federal Budget Process 101 The Executive Budget Process Timetable 4.4.2 Congressional Budget Resolution The CBO explains the Congressional Budget Resolution as follows: …a blueprint to guide Congressional action on budget-related legislation over the course of the year. It does not provide funding for federal programs or change tax law; rather, it sets overall spending and revenue targets, sometimes for as many as 10 years. A budget resolution is not a law, because it is not signed by the President; it takes effect if approved by both Houses of Congress. The Congressional Budget Resolutions set spending ceilings for 20 budget functions and include revenue estimates. The budget resolution is drafted by the House and Senate budget committees, followed by floor votes where amendments are passed by majority vote. Any differences between the House and Senate are resolved in conference committees, and the resolution cannot be filibustered. The resolution is expected to pass by April 1, but if delayed or not passed, the previous year’s resolution remains in effect. Budget resolutions are enforced by allowing House and Senate members to block legislation that violates the resolution, although this can be waived by a simple majority in the House or 60 votes in the Senate. Budget reconciliation is used to enforce spending cuts or tax increases specified in the resolution, with reconciliation directives providing detailed instructions for achieving these fiscal targets by a set deadline. 4.4.3 Appropriation Bills Annual appropriations are necessary for discretionary (but not mandatory) funding. Those appropriation bills become law with the President’s signature. The appropriation bills are drafted by the appropriation committees (i.e., Senate and House). In the past, the on-time passage of all appropriation bills before the start of the Federal fiscal year has be difficult (see Congress has long struggled to pass spending bills on time from the Pew Research Center). Since 1977 (the first year of the current system), only four years (1977, 1989, 1995, and 1997) had all appropriation bills passed on time. Often, so-called omnibus bills are passed meaning all appropriation bills are packed into one bill. The Appropriations Status Table shows the progress of the current bills. Example of an appropriation bill S.3109 - Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2019 Appropriation Accounts Appropriation accounts serve as a key framework for expenditure control, reflecting Congress’s “power of the purse” as outlined in the U.S. Constitution (Article I, Section 9). These accounts are the primary mechanism through which Congress allocates funds to specific programs and are essential for agencies in preparing budget requests. They function as the basic units for internal control within agencies, ensuring spending remains within the limits set by Congress. Appropriation accounts also provide the foundation for reporting and auditing processes.

Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance (OASDI): This social insurance program is better known under the term Social Security. It is comprised of two trust funds, i.e., Old-Age and Survivors Insurance (OASI) and Disability Insurance (DI). OASI is for retired workers and their dependents as well as the survivors of deceased workers. DI is for disabled workers and and their depedents. Both funds are financed by earmarked payroll taxes (Annual Report) 4.6.1 Medicare Medicare is a federal health insurance program primarily for individuals aged 65 and older, as well as certain younger people with disabilities. It consists of several parts: Part A covers hospital and inpatient services, Part B covers outpatient medical care, Part C (Medicare Advantage) offers an alternative to traditional Medicare through private plans, and Part D provides prescription drug coverage. Medicare is funded through a combination of payroll taxes, premiums, and general federal revenues. 4.6.2 Medicaid Medicaid is a joint federal and state program that provides medical care for low-income individuals. Unlike Medicare, it does not have a trust fund and is financed through general federal and state funds. For every dollar a state spends on Medicaid, the federal government provides at least $1 in matching funds, with higher matching rates for poorer states. On average, the federal government covers about 57% of Medicaid costs across all states. 4.6.3 Problems with Social Insurance Financing Until mid-1980s, handled as “pay-as-you-go” Premiums collected this year covered benefits paid this year Problem: Falling ratio of workers to beneficiaries, i.e., benefits payout exceeding payments Reasons: Low birthrates, retirement of baby boomers, low death rates 5 workers for each recipient in 1960 and 2 to 1 by 2030 Increase in health care costs Possible solution: Actuarial Funding Pay into the fund during working years Receive principal plus interest upon retirement CBO Report (February 1996): Mandatory Spending Control Mechanisms Population Age 65 and over Actuarial Funding for Social Insurance Programs Establishment of trust funds Dedication of payments to fund (payroll taxes) during individual’s working life Investment of funds in secure investment vehicles (e.g., U.S. government securities) Use of fund’s proceeds (i.e., contributions plus interest earnings) for benefit coverage during retirement Application Possible for Social Security and Medicare: Predictable cycle of work following retirement Not possible for Medicaid: No predictable cycle of prosperity and poverty "],["federal-debt.html", "4.7 Federal Debt", " 4.7 Federal Debt Problems associated with federal debt Threat to long-term economic growth due to resources taken out of the capital market and not allocated to productive use (e.g., loans to firms) Payments to foreign investors Constrains response to important issues (e.g., financial crisis, COVID-19) Potential for inflation in the case of debt monetization (unlikely in countries with strong institutions) Federal Budget Cycle In general, the federal budget cycle involves four steps: Executive preparation Legislative review and approval Budget implementation Audit and evaluation Tasks and functions of agencies and institutions involved in the budget: Executive branch agency: Office of Management and Budget Legislative branch agency: Congressional Budget Office House and Senate subcommittees, appropriation bills, etc. Other concepts to know: Mandatory versus discretionary spending Federal deficit: Consequences Political, economic, and demographic factors contributing to the change in spending and the federal budget deficit Current Services Baseline Current Services Estimate (see CBPP The Current Services Baseline: A Tool for Understanding Budget Choices) Baseline or benchmark “reflecting this year’s enacted policies and programs for each year in the future” Part of supporting material (e.g., current services budget) Submission of President’s annual budget and supporting materials to Congress "],["exercises-2.html", "4.8 Exercises", " 4.8 Exercises https://www.cbo.gov/publication/58981 Agency Budget III (**): Use one of the following federal agencies for this exercise: Fish and Wildlife Service, Forest Service, Bureau of Land Management, Bureau of Reclamation, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, U.S. Geological Survey, Army Corps of Engineers, Environmental Protection Agency, and U.S. Coast Guard.

One fundamental requirement is efficiency, meaning that allocating $1 to program A should provide the same level of benefit as allocating $1 to program B. However, it can be difficult to value government goods and services due to several challenges. First, governments often have multiple objectives, some of which may conflict with each other. Additionally, there is no common mechanism to measure and compare the returns of different programs, making it hard to assess which investments are most beneficial. Another challenge is the variation in beneficiaries across programs, as well as differences between those who benefit from programs and those who pay for them. These factors complicate the process of evaluating budgetary allocations and ensuring that resources are distributed efficiently and fairly. "],["budget-classification.html", "5.2 Budget Classification", " 5.2 Budget Classification Budgets can be centered around (1) inputs, (2) outputs, or (3) outcomes. Budgets can be classified according to inputs, outputs, and outcomes, which reflect different stages of an organization’s activities and impact. Inputs refer to the purchases made by the organization, such as supplies, equipment, labor, consumption goods, and capital assets. These inputs are relatively easy to measure and control because they represent tangible expenditures and resources used by the organization. Outputs are the direct products or activities produced by the organization. These include measurable actions such as classes taught, miles of roads maintained, tons of solid waste managed, arrests made, and children vaccinated. Outputs represent the immediate results of the organization’s operations. Outcomes, on the other hand, are the accomplishments of the organization, reflecting the broader impact of its activities. Examples include the safety of people and property, the educational attainment of the population, and the successful placement of program participants. Outcomes are often the most difficult to measure because they are influenced by external factors beyond the organization’s control. Ultimately, organizations exist to achieve results, and understanding inputs, outputs, and outcomes helps clarify how resources contribute to achieving these goals. "],["budget-types.html", "5.3 Budget Types", " 5.3 Budget Types There are several types of budgets, each with a different focus: Traditional line-item budget: Focuses on expenditures and inputs, detailing specific costs like salaries and supplies. Program budget: Organized around functions and programs, emphasizing the goals and purposes of government activities. Performance budget: Centers on activities and outputs. The traditional performance budget emphasizes activities, while the new performance budget shifts focus to measurable outputs. Zero-based budget: Requires justification for all expenses, starting from a “zero base” each period, ensuring that each activity is necessary and cost-effective. 5.3.1 Line Item Budget A traditional line-item budget focuses on listing expenditures by item, ensuring control and accountability over the purchase and use of inputs. It is input-oriented and classifies costs into general categories such as personal services, operating expenses, or capital outlays. The main focus is on resources purchased. Given how the line item budget is constructed, it does not allow for input substitution given, for examples, changes in input prices. We know from economics that when input prices change, there occurs a shift along the so-called isoquant. That is, producing the same output with a different combinations of inputs. We will see that the line item budget does not provide any information on activities or functions. Remember that (public) organizations exist to achieve goals. Consider the budget of a municipal library below. The budget listing the operating income can be constructed as follows: Operating Income Last Fiscal Year Current Budget Next Fiscal Year Municipality $41,640 $39,050 $47,190 County $26,400 $23,980 $28,600 State $1,800 $1,925 $2,730 Donations $600 $550 $650 Fines and Other Income $1,560 $2,310 $2,730 Total $72,000 $67,815 $81,900 For the operating expenditures, we can have the following: Operating Expenditures Last Fiscal Year Current Budget Next Fiscal Year Salaries and Wages $28,980 $27,170 $33,345 Employee Benefits $20,100 $18,700 $21,255 Books and Periodicals $11,520 $11,000 $13,650 Staff Education $2,280 $2,145 $2,730 Telecommunications $1,710 $1,650 $2,048 Utilities $4,560 $4,400 $5,460 Equipment Repair $1,140 $1,100 $1,365 Supplies $1,710 $1,650 $2,048 Total $72,000 $67,815 $81,900 The budget under consideration offers several advantages that facilitate financial management. It is easy to construct, making budgetary planning straightforward and manageable. Additionally, it is effective for maintaining cost control and fiscal discipline, ensuring that expenditures stay within allocated limits. The transparency of this budgeting method also enhances accountability, making it easier to track and justify expenditures. However, there are notable disadvantages. The budget primarily focuses on inputs rather than the outputs or outcomes, which does not provide a clear indication of the effectiveness or efficiency of spending. It also lacks insight into the broader purposes of expenditures, such as improvements in service programs, which can be crucial for strategic decision-making. Furthermore, its short-term, single-year focus does not support long-term planning and sustainability. Lastly, the rigidity of this budgeting method offers no flexibility for input substitution, restricting adaptability to changing needs or conditions. Question: Are there any data on books checked out or reading score improvements for children? 5.3.2 Program Budget Program budgets shift the focus of resource allocation from traditional line-items to major program areas with a goal-oriented framework, i.e., serving a common public purpose. Expenditures are listed by activities. This method prioritizes the expected results of services and activities, organizing budget allocations around a common purpose or function rather than rigid departmental structures. It typically adopts a multi-year perspective, offering greater flexibility in execution and necessitating a “crosswalk” to align program budgets with traditional line-item formats. Common program areas often include public safety, public works (e.g., infrastructure, roads), and human resources, which are aligned with the organization’s overarching goals and often span multiple departments. The features of program budgets include identifying products and services by their program structure, emphasizing outcomes over inputs. Programs with similar objectives are grouped together. This structure helps connect financial resources with program objectives through the use of crosswalks, enhancing the alignment between spending and strategic goals. Budgets are organized to group programs with similar objectives, such as fire and police departments under public safety, facilitating a unified approach to service provision. Moreover, by identifying cost and benefit data, program budgets enable the reallocation of resources to enhance program effectiveness and efficiency, supporting thorough reviews and adjustments of programs and subprograms. The advantages of program budgets are manifold. They foster competition among alternative approaches to achieving public purposes, unbound by traditional organizational units. This budgeting method focuses on the government’s provision of goods and services to society, rather than mere purchases, supporting a longer horizon for planning and decision-making. However, program budgets are not without challenges. They require the use of crosswalks to bridge the gap with other budget classifications, often necessary for accountability purposes. This approach can also disrupt legislative and administrative traditions, which typically focus on line-item appropriations, and the classification of expenditures into functions or programs can be complex, requiring significant effort to define clear goals and objectives. Additionally, the potential for overlapping structures among programs can complicate the budgeting process, presenting hurdles in clear accountability and execution. How to determine the programs (multiple competing objectives) Below is an example of a possible program structure for a city. The example is taken from Alan W. Steiss’s lecture notes on program budgeting at the University of Michigan: Public Safety: (a) Law Enforcement, (b) Traffic Safety, (c) Fire Safety, (d) Maintenance of Public Order, (e) Prevention &amp; Control of Other Hazards, and (f) Administration &amp; Support Housing &amp; Community Development: (a) Housing Standards &amp; Code Enforcement, (b) Community Improvement, and (c) Administration &amp; Support Transportation: (a) Traffic Control &amp; Accessibility, (b) Street Development &amp; Maintenance, (c) Mass Transportation, and (d) Administration &amp; Support Environmental Enhancement &amp; Protection: (a) Environmental Health, (b) Water Services, (c) Sewer Services, (d) Sanitation Services, (e) Environmental Code Enforcement, and (f) Administration &amp; Support Human Resources: (a) Conservation of Health, (b) Personnel, Payroll &amp; Benefits, (c) Vocational Rehabilitation, (d) Public Health Services, (e) Ambulance &amp; Rescue Squad Services Education: (a) Public Schools, (b) Adult &amp;Vocations Education, (c) Community College Services, and (d) Higher Education Opportunities Recreation &amp; Culture: (a) Recreation &amp; Parks, (b) Youth Opportunities, (c) Cultural Enrichment (inc.

This methodology is built upon several key elements. First, it identifies the level of service an organization aims to achieve through the use of performance measures. Resources are then allocated across various programs based on these predefined service levels, providing a structured outline for budget construction. The emphasis is on cost control and the enhancement of internal management within programs, constantly assessing whether the funds allocated—such as $X to activity A—are delivering the intended outcomes. This leads to critical evaluations of financial commitments, asking if the objectives are met and if adjustments are necessary. This shift in budgeting paradigm moves away from traditional input-output models to a more dynamic output-outcome focus. Instead of merely tracking financial inputs and basic outputs, performance budgets concentrate on the results, overall performance, and the tangible outcomes of government expenditures. This shift aims to ensure that budgeted funds are not just spent, but spent effectively, creating impactful results that justify the investments made. Let us consider the example of the Sunnyvale (CA) City Budget. We are going to focus on the public safety progamrs by the Department of Public Safety: Police Services Fire Services Community Safety Services Personnel and Training Investigation Services Communication Services Public Safety Administrative Services Records Management and Property Services Fire Prevention and Hazardous Material Services Community Preservation Services The budget document provides the following workload and performance indicators: Workload indicators: Number of traffic enforcement stops.

Number of traffic complaints addressed by enforcement efforts Number of police responses to emergency events Performance Indicators Average police response time to emergency events. Average police response time to urgent events Next, we will discuss the differences between a traditional and new performance budgets: Traditional Performance Budget: The features of a traditional performance budget is focusing on the relationship between inputs and outputs/outcomes. It integrates the budgeting with (long-term) planning and management. Activity cost (i.e., unit cost) within organizational units as well as workload factors are defined. Consider the following examples of performance indicators found at GA Municipal Association Budget Types): Workload: Number customers served, miles of streets maintained, businesses inspected, etc. Efficiency: Cost per unit Effectiveness: Levels of satisfaction, % of targets met, etc. The advantages of Advantages Information for internal management and cost containment (technical efficiency) Higher levels of accountability, i.e., demonstration of activities and service level Tool for management responsibility and accountability due to assessment of quantity, quality, and productivity of the budget Disadvantages Cost of budget preparation Exposition of operating details Quality of performance measures New Performance Budget: Principles Principles Strategic plan with stated objectives Development of outcome performance measures Flexibility in appropriation and execution Agencies’ flexibility in spending appropriations in order to achieve stated objectives (not input controlled but responsibility for outcomes) Reporting and audits focus on outcomes, i.e., meeting of objectives New Performance Budget: Outcome Measures I Outcome measures Specific policy goals or objectives Used as mechanism to allocate resources for activities, inputs, and projects to achieve goals and objectives Measures should link directly to mission statement Limited importance and weight given to objectives in case of large number of objectives New Performance Budget: Outcome Measures II More specifics about outcome measures Clear and unambiguous, not necessarily quantitative Relevant and appropriate to the objective, not just available Economic, i.e., objective measured at reasonable cost Adequate: Providing acceptable basis for assessing performance Observable and measurable Conditions for effectiveness of outcome orientation Consensus on measures among operating agencies, finance departments, administration, and citizens Means for unbiased collection of measures Meaningful measures Training on interpretation and use of measures Transparent and understandable process New Performance Budget: Challenges Comparing agency performance Measures not comparable across agencies Difficulty deciding how to allocate resources between agencies Cost allocation Difficulty allocating overhead expenses to various agencies Micro-management Political agendas in selection of measures, collection of data, or use of measures in preparing budgets or making appropriations Audit Focus on achieved goals and not spent money Performance Budgets versus Program Budgets Difference in focus Performance budget emphasizes management efficiency Program budget emphasizes benefits to the governmental unit from the expenditures Both use indicators to measure financial and operational performance "],["zero-based-budget.html", "5.4 Zero-Based Budget", " 5.4 Zero-Based Budget Basic elements Defend entire budget annually No automatic base to start from Focus on entire budget, not just increase "],["advantages-and-disadvantages.html", "5.5 Advantages and Disadvantages", " 5.5 Advantages and Disadvantages Advantages Lots of operating data Consideration of alternative delivery devices Formal consideration of priorities Focus on agency and department objectives Disadvantages Significant effort in budget construction Not all programs can be zeroed out Implicit path dependency "],["exercises-3.html", "5.6 Exercises", " 5.6 Exercises How has the composition of federal, state, and local government spending changed over the past 40 years?

"],["cost-accounting-and-analysis.html", "6 Cost Accounting and Analysis", " 6 Cost Accounting and Analysis Cost accounting refers to the classification of financial information from a budget or financial reports into cost categories based on the agency’s cost structure analysis regarding the relationship of resources spent and major services provided. The Oregon Accounting Manual 2010 of the Department of Administrative Services defines cost accounting as follows. A method of accounting which provides for assembling and recording all elements of cost incurred to accomplish a purpose, to carry on an activity or operation, or to complete a unit of work or specific job. Cost analysis is the use of cost data to analyze the determinants of costs and evaluate changes in agency operation. It is the basis for setting user fees for public services and is a decision tool for service contraction or expansion. This chapter covers aspects of cost accounting and analysis. There are slides as well as three YouTube videos associated with this chapter: General concepts are outlined in the video Cost Accounting Concepts The Hoosier County Road Department video is an example of a non-personnel cost analysis. The Hoosier Police Department video is an example of a personnel cost analysis. Note that the latter two videos are linked again in the respective sections below. We also cover break-even analysis using garbage collection as an example. Before diving into the topics, let us define some terminology first: Obligation: An obligation is the responsibility to meet the terms of a contract. For example, road salt purchases in June for delivery in October Outlay: Outlays are the physical outflow of cash. For example, the payment for road salt in September. Cost: Actual use and consumption of the resource. For example, road salt consumption in December and January as cost in two different calendar years Usually, there are small dollar amount differences between obligations, outlays, and cost. "],["cost-accounting.html", "6.1 Cost Accounting", " 6.1 Cost Accounting Cost accounting aims to assign costs to services and categories in a manner that supports effective cost analysis. This process relies on various data sources, including past budgets, operational reports, and contracts or billing statements. A key aspect of cost accounting is the determination of mission or service centers, which involves categorizing the primary services provided to the public. For example, in a Department of Transportation, road maintenance could be identified as a key service center. This categorization helps to accurately track and analyz costs associated with specific functions or services. In cost accounting, direct costs refer to expenses that can be directly and accurately assigned to a specific service or project. For example, the cost of asphalt used to repave Meridian Street in Indianapolis is a direct cost because it is clearly linked to that specific project. On the other hand, indirect costs are those that cannot be precisely assigned to a specific service due to the lack of a direct causal link between the expense and the service provided. An example of an indirect cost would be the salary of a manager overseeing road maintenance in Indianapolis, as their work supports multiple projects rather than a single, specific service. One of the goals of cost accounting is to convert as many indirect costs as possible into direct costs by creating more precise links between costs and the services provided, improving the accuracy of cost allocation. Cost concepts in accounting help distinguish how expenses behave in relation to the level of output or services provided: Fixed cost: This type of cost remains constant and does not vary with the level of output. An example is office space rent, which remains the same regardless of how much work or service is being performed. Variable cost: These costs fluctuate based on the level of goods or services provided. For instance, the cost of paving roads using asphalt increases as more roads are paved. Semi-variable cost: These costs contain both fixed and variable components. An example is a copy machine, where there is a fixed rental fee but additional costs accrue based on the number of copies made. Step cost: These costs change with output but in discrete jumps rather than continuously. For example, a school may need to hire one additional teacher for every 20 students, resulting in a step-like increase in costs as student numbers grow. Other key cost concepts include the full (total) cost which includes all resources utilized to produce a service. The unit cost is the total cost divided by total quantity. In economics, this is called the average total cost. For a government agency (but also for industry and nonprofits) it is important to know the average total cost. If the price per unit sold (or service provided) is below the average total cost, the service provision is not sustainable in the long run. Finally, we have marginal cost which is the change in total cost if one more unit of service is provided or one more unit of output is produced. "],["cost-accounting-steps.html", "6.2 Cost Accounting Steps", " 6.2 Cost Accounting Steps The cost accounting involves the following steps to assign costs to specific services or mission centers: Identification of mission centers Identification of activity and output units Identification of expenditure categories Identification of allocation factors Linking cost to mission centers In the following, we are going to describe each of those steps in detail. Identification of Mission Centers: This first step involves categorizing the parts, i.e., mission centers, of the organization that provide direct services to the public. These mission centers represent separate services for which unit costs need to be developed. For example, a water department may have the mission centers “water distribution” and “water treatment.” Other examples would be “fire suppression” and “fire prevention” for a fire department or “garbage collection” and “garbage disposal” for a sanitation Department. By identifying these mission centers, organizations can better assess the cost of providing each service and appropriately allocate resources or set rates for users. Identification of Activity and Output Units: This entails defining measurable units of service or output (e.g., miles of road maintained, number of public safety incidents handled) to calculate per-unit cost of services. Each mission center needs to have clearly defined, measurable units of activity or output to allow for accurate cost analysis. These units should directly reflect the service provided by the mission center. Identifying these measurable activity or output units allows organizations to allocate costs effectively and calculate the cost per unit of service provided. For example: In a nursing home, the output unit might be the number of resident days. For garbage collection, it could be the number of tons of waste collected or the number of pickups. In a water department, the unit might be the volume of water treated or distributed, measured in gallons or liters. For a police department, the unit could be the number of incidents responded to or cases handled. Identification of Expenditure Categories: Costs are categorized into groups such as labor, materials, or overhead to facilitate better tracking and analysis. Usually, we differentiate between personnel and non-personnel expenditures. Personnel expenditures are usually composed of salaries and fringe benefits (e.g., health insurance, Social Security). Non-personnel expenditures include items such supplies, equipment, utilities, or facilities Identification of Allocation Factors: Allocation factors are determined to fairly distribute indirect costs (like administrative expenses) across different mission centers based on relevant drivers, such as hours worked or resources used. Requirement of using allocation factors to link indirect cost to mission centers Indirect Cost Allocation Factor Facilities Square footage Overhead Direct personnel or direct cost Liability insurance Direct personnel or output Computer usage Direct personnel or output Printing services Output Linking Costs to Mission Centers: In a fifth step, costs are linked to the mission centers based on direct and allocated expenses, providing a clear picture of how resources are consumed by each service or function. In the previous section, we differentiated between direct cost (i.e., expenses that are directly assigned to a specific mission center) and indirect costs (i.e., expenses that cannot be directly assigned to a specific mission center). There is also overhead which refers to costs associated with providing administrative services to all mission centers. This includes the salaries of management, as well as insurance, utilities, and facilities costs, particularly when usage cannot be directly linked to a specific mission center.

On the cost side, we have annual fixed cost that are composed of administrative services ($35,000) and equipment lease ($85,000). The variable cost per container is composed of a landfill charge ($1) and equipment operation on collection routes ($0.40).

"],["personnel-cost-versus-non-personnel-cost.html", "6.5 Personnel Cost versus Non-Personnel Cost", " 6.5 Personnel Cost versus Non-Personnel Cost We make the distinction between personnel and non-personnel cost. Personnel cost are usually the largest single component of a budget and include wages, salaries, and fringe benefits. In general, total salary expenses are defined as \\(N \\times w\\) where \\(N\\) represents the number of workers in a given working grade and \\(w\\) represents the wage per worker for said working grade. Whereas non-personnel cost are relatively straightforward to calculate and ultimately result in the cost per unit produced or provided times the number of units, personnel cost need to keep track of the steps (grades) which vary with education, experience, and tenure of each employee. Budgeting for non-personnel cost can be done by the so-called incremental method, which adjust past cost for inflation, i.e., last years expenditures times (1+inflation rate). Since this method does not account for the possibility of input substitution, the unit cost method can be use that calculates $ per unit of output (unit costs).

Given the population size of the district, you need nine patrol cars at any given time. Patrols are 24 hours per day and 365 days per year. For safety reasons, each patrol requires two officers per car. Those officers work eight hour shifts per day on five days per week. All officers receive three weeks of vacation and and sick leave (i.e., two weeks of vacation and one week of sick leave). The salary per police officer is $61,200 with 30$ fringe benefits.

Each bus has a capacity of 60 passengers. The average cost per bus is $450 per day and includes fuel, maintenance, depreciation, and the driver’s salary. MCPTA charges a flat fare of $1.50 per ride. Each bus does 10 round trips per day on its route. The buses currently operate at 75% capacity on average. Thus, each bus has 1,020 per day given those numbers. Overhead is currently $3.5 million. MCPTA expects that the new expansion would decrease ridership because of the transport network being expanded. However, with this expansion, fixed costs (infrastructure, administrative overhead, etc.) would rise by an additional $30,000 annually. Calculate the break-even capacity in percent that MCPTA needs in order to cover the new total operating costs with the expanded fleet. Assume buses operate 365 days a year. Show all steps in your calculations, including the new total costs, revenues, and break-even analysis. If MCPTA considers raising the fare to $1.75 per ride, how would this affect the break-even number of daily passengers? Would this new fare reduce the financial risk of the expansion? Explain. Assuming the break-even analysis is marginally viable, discuss other public finance factors that could impact MCPTA’s decision to expand (e.g., subsidies, long-term infrastructure costs, elasticity of demand, social welfare, or environmental benefits). What are your recommendations? Municipal Electric Utility Expansion (***): The City of Hoosier Valley operates its own municipal electric utility (HV Electric) and provides electricity to 100,000 households. The current generation capacity is 500 GWh (gigawatt-hours) per year, and the utility operates at 85% of its capacity. The utility charges $0.12 per kWh (kilowatt-hour), and the total annual operating cost (including fixed and variable costs) is $40 million. The fixed costs, which include infrastructure maintenance, administrative overhead, and long-term debt servicing, account for 60% of the total annual cost. Due to population growth and increasing energy consumption, the city anticipates a 20% increase in demand for electricity over the next 5 years. HV Electric is considering expanding its capacity to 600 GWh by investing in renewable energy sources (solar and wind). The expansion would increase the annual fixed cost 5 million in one-time capital costs, spread equally over the next 5 years, plus an ongoing annual increase of $3 million in variable operating costs (fuel, labor, maintenance). The city is also considering raising the electricity rate to $0.14 per kWh to finance the expansion and offset rising costs. The proposed rate increase is expected to reduce overall electricity usage by 3%. Task 1: Break-Even Analysis for Capacity Expansion Calculate the break-even point for GV Electric’s total costs under the expanded capacity scenario. How many GWh must the utility sell annually to cover all its costs (including the additional operating costs due to expansion)? Include both fixed and variable costs in your analysis. How does the new break-even sales level compare to the projected electricity demand (including the rate increase impact on demand)? Will the expanded capacity meet or exceed the break-even point? Task 2: Sensitivity Analysis on Pricing If GV Electric does not raise prices, how much additional electricity must it sell annually to cover the increased costs from the capacity expansion alone? How does this compare to the anticipated 20% increase in demand? Analyze the sensitivity of the break-even point to changes in price elasticity of demand. If the demand elasticity is underestimated, and the actual decrease in demand is 5% instead of 3%, what impact does this have on the break-even analysis? Task 3: Risk and Policy Considerations Given the sensitivity of the break-even point to pricing and demand, what are the financial risks to GV Electric if they proceed with the expansion under uncertain demand? Discuss how other factors—such as government subsidies for renewable energy, carbon taxes, or potential technological improvements in efficiency—might affect the financial viability of this project.

In this chapter, we are going to cover the following topics: Capital assets and expenditures Capital budgeting process Capital asset financing options Net present value Cost benefit analysis There are also a YouTube video and slides associated with this chapter "],["capital-assets-and-expenditures.html", "7.1 Capital Assets and Expenditures", " 7.1 Capital Assets and Expenditures From an economic viewpoint, capital assets have a useful life of more than one year whereas from an accounting perspective, capital assets have a purchase price above a certain dollar amount. Capital assets are inputs in the production process of private goods (e.g., manufacturing facility) and public goods (e.g., schools, hospitals, fire stations, infrastructure). Capital expenditures are outlays to purchase capital assets and have implications beyond a single financial period and high initial cost on large tangible projects. Those expenditures are non-recurring except for operation and maintenance covered by recurrent budgets. Since a large infrastructure investment has a lifetime beyond one year, borrowing of capital to support capital expenditures is appropriate due to service provision over multiple years. This ensures that current tax payers are not responsible to cover the entire capital expenditure and that future residents pay their appropriate share. "],["capital-budgeting-process.html", "7.2 Capital Budgeting Process", " 7.2 Capital Budgeting Process There are multiple reasons for a capital budgeting process, which is distinct from the process for recurrent budgets. First, there are long-term (permanent) consequences of acquiring a capital asset. Capital projects often provide services over many years or decades, with taxpayers bearing the costs over the asset’s lifespan (inter-generational equity). The process separates capital expenditures from the recurrent budget and accounts for the time gap between initial outlays and future benefits. Second, technical risks (e.g., operating electric buses for the first time in a public transportation network) stemming from the one-time nature of many projects, and financial risks related to the future burden of debt financing need to be assessed prior to investment. Third, a long-term perspective on infrastructure stabilizes tax rates because expenditures are spread out over time, which reduces the immediate tax burden. The key steps in the capital budgeting process can be summarized as follows: Identification of current capital asset inventory and future needs Project evaluation and selection Planning of financing and long-term financial analysis Implementation of the capital budget and project management Post-implementation activities such as operations, maintenance, and asset management Note that due to the size of the federal government, there is no formal federal capital budgeting process since no single project would limit spending in other areas. 7.2.1 Inventory of Capital Assets and Future Needs The current inventory of facilities involves evaluating factors such as the age, condition, usage, capacity, and replacement cost. This assessment may also include estimates for renovation, replacement, expansion, or retirement of facilities, with the possibility of incorporating some of those expenditures into the recurrent budget. In terms of service characteristics, it is important to consider the current and future cost per unit of service provided by these facilities. The ideal situation would involve having an asset management plan that details the list of capital assets, associated maintenance costs, and other relevant information. Such a plan would serve as the foundation for decisions regarding the expansion of facilities and the planning of capital maintenance projects. A vision regarding the future direction for the (local) economy, land-use, and development often precedes a plan to acquire capital assets. Such a vision (or plan) forecasts the need for future facilities (e.g., roads, sewage, libraries) given community growth and economic development. It estimates demand for services such as parks, transportation, offices, and residential needs. Here are some example for such plans: Strategic Asset Managment Plan for Berkeley, California Indianapolis Parks and Recreation Carmel Comprehensive Plan 2022 You can also find some additional information at Government Finance Officers Association (GFOA): Master Plans and Capital Improvement Planning Let us have a closer look at the Saint Paul for All 2040 Comprehensive Plan. Major trends informing the comprehensive plan policy are climate change, aging housing stock and infrastructure, constrained financial resources to pay for city services and facilities, and changing demographics. The plan identifies challenges and opportunities for the future including (1) equity, (2) growth and density, (3) economic development and opportunity sites, (4) climate change mitigation, adaptation, and resiliency, (5) designing a city for all ages and abilities, (6) fostering the next generation, and (7) new technologies and their impact on development patterns. 7.2.2 Project Evaluation and Selection The cost of a project includes various components such as research and development, legal and other associated fees, as well as the construction cost itself. Beyond the initial outlay, life-cycle expenses must also be considered, including the costs of ongoing operation and maintenance, as well as major repairs throughout the project’s lifespan. When evaluating a project, its overall effectiveness should be compared against the option of renovating existing facilities. This comparison should take into account both the project cost and the associated life-cycle expenses. Additionally, the appropriateness of the project should be assessed based on its alignment with the priorities outlined in the master plan. A Capital Improvement Plan (CIP) is a multi-year strategic plan that provides detailed information, documentation, and justification for various capital projects, including the construction of new facilities as well as the renovation and replacement of existing ones. It outlines the financial and timing aspects of these projects, specifying cost and financing details, and ensuring the proper sequencing of work, such as installing sewer lines and utility cables before repaving roads. The CIP is typically updated on an annual basis to reflect new priorities and emerging needs. It offers several advantages, such as providing a multi-year perspective for long-range policy development, aligning community goals with financial capacity, and fostering public consensus through a dynamic planning process. Additionally, the CIP serves as a critical financial management tool, assisting with credit ratings and acting as a comprehensive reporting document. The CIP development process is guided by executive directions that establish project priorities. Cost estimates are provided by various agencies based on their needs, and the process may also include input from citizens to ensure that the plan reflects the community’s concerns and expectations. 7.2.3 Financing Plan and Long-Term Financial Analysis After the selection of projects has been made, long-term financial projections and a financing plan is developed. This includes projecting tax revenue and baseline expenditures over time. There are two financing options for capital projects and acquisitions: Pay-as-you-go and pay-as-you-use. “Pay-as-you-go” financing refers to funding capital projects using current revenue sources rather than incurring debt. For example, infrastructure investments may be financed through motor fuel taxes or other non-debt sources such as grants from state or federal governments, as well as accumulated reserves. This approach offers several advantages. First, it eliminates the need for interest payments, reducing the overall cost of the project. It also preserves the option to borrow for other projects in the future, providing financial flexibility. However, pay-as-you-go financing also has disadvantages. It may necessitate increases in taxes or fees to generate the necessary revenue, which can be unpopular or politically challenging. There may also be a misalignment between the timing of payments and the benefits of the capital asset, as current taxpayers bear the full cost of an asset that will provide benefits over many years. Additionally, reliance on this method can result in underinvestment in capital assets if sufficient revenue is not available to fund all necessary projects. “Pay-as-you-use” financing involves funding capital projects through debt, such as bonds or other debt instruments issued by the government. The repayment of this debt is spread over the lifetime of the asset, ensuring that future users contribute to its cost. Leasing is another form of this approach, where the use of assets is paid for over time. The main advantages of pay-as-you-use financing include the avoidance of immediate tax increases and a better alignment between the timing of payments and the benefits provided by the capital asset. This ensures that future generations, who will also benefit from the asset, share in its costs. However, the approach comes with disadvantages. Debt service can place significant constraints on the operating budget, as funds are allocated toward repaying the debt rather than other needs. Additionally, relying on debt financing can lead to a high debt burden, potentially affecting the government’s credit rating and financial stability in the long term. Possibility of combination between pay-as-you-go and pay-as-you-use financing 7.2.4 Financial Analysis over Capital Asset Lifetime A comprehensive financial analysis over the lifetime of a capital asset considers several factors that impact the project’s revenue capacity, borrowing potential, and long-term financial viability. The revenue capacity refers to the ability to generate own-source revenue and the proportion of that revenue available for capital investments. The approach taken—whether pay-as-you-go or pay-as-you-use—can significantly influence the amount of capital available. Pay-as-you-go relies on current revenue sources, while pay-as-you-use spreads the cost over time through debt financing. The borrowing capacity of an entity is determined by the total debt relative to its size, interest rates, and debt service obligations. Credit ratings also play a crucial role, as they affect the terms and availability of future borrowing. Higher debt burdens can limit future borrowing options and increase financial risk. Some capital assets generate revenue directly through user charges or fees. The financial analysis must project these revenues and determine what share, if any, will be dedicated to capital investment or debt service, helping offset costs over time. External contributions, such as federal and state aid or partnerships with private entities (public-private partnerships), can supplement financing. These external sources reduce the direct burden on the entity and diversify the financing mix for capital projects. A critical factor in financial analysis is the ongoing impact of the capital asset on the operating budget. Annual operating and maintenance costs, as well as debt service obligations, must be assessed. Debt service as a percentage of budget revenues will determine how much room remains for other operational needs. Other revenue sources that may contribute to capital financing include one-time development impact fees, special assessments, or the sale of existing assets. These can provide immediate capital injections but are typically non-recurring, meaning they are limited in scope and availability. This financial analysis framework helps ensure a balanced, long-term approach to capital investments, minimizing risks and aligning financial strategies with organizational goals.

Before presenting the method, we need to introduce compounding and discounting interest. The concept of compounding interest illustrates how an initial deposit grows over time due to interest being calculated on both the initial principal and the accumulated interest. Consider an example with an initial deposit of $100 and a 5% interest rate compounded annually over three years. At the start of year 1, the initial balance is $100. With an interest rate of 5%, the interest earned during the first year is $5 (\\(100 \\cdot 0.05\\)), resulting in an ending balance of $105. In year 2, interest is calculated on the new balance of $105, earning $5.25 (\\(105 \\cdot 0.05\\)), bringing the ending balance to $110.25. By year 3, the balance of $110.25 earns $5.51 in interest (\\(110.25 \\cdot 0.05\\)), resulting in a final balance of $115.76. The general formula for compounding interest can be written as follows: \\[FV = PV \\cdot (1+r)^t\\] where \\(r\\) is the interest rate, \\(t\\) is the number of time periods (years), and \\(PV\\) and \\(FV\\) are present and future value, respectively. Discounting interest is the opposite operation in which we determine the present value (PV) given a flow of money to be received in the future. The interest rate used to determine the present value is called the discount rate \\(r\\). This concept reflects the idea that money received in the future is worth less than money received today due to factors like inflation or opportunity cost (e.g., investments). For example, if you receive $100 every year for the next three years and the discount rate is 6%, the present value of each $100 payment decreases over time. In the first year, the present value of $100 is calculated as follows: \\[\\frac{100}{(1+0.06)}= 94.34\\] In the second year, the present value of $100 is calculated as: \\[\\frac{100}{(1+0.06)^2}=89.00\\] In the third year, it is \\[\\frac{100}{(1+0.06)^3}=83.96\\] By discounting the future payments, the total present value of receiving $100 each year for three years is the sum of these discounted amounts, which is less than the nominal $300 but represents the equivalent value in today’s terms, i.e., $267.30. Put differently, if you put $267.30 in a bank account today at 6% interest rate then you can withdraw exactly $100 at the end of each of the following three years. The general formula is written as follows: \\[PV_t=\\frac{FV_t}{(1+r)^t}\\] Consider the following setup for a Net Present Value calculation. Suppose you receive a cash flow of $100,000 in each of the next ten years at an interest rate of 6%. The NPV formula is generally written as follows: \\[NPV=\\sum_{t=1}^T \\frac{X_t}{(1+r)^t}\\] In the example given, this translates into the following equation: \\[NPV=\\sum_{t=1}^T \\frac{100,000}{(1.06)^t}=736,008.71\\] Next, consider the example of renovating a football field with two options for the turf. The first option is artificial turf with initial cost is $500,000 but does not require any maintenance for 10 years. The second option is natural turf, which requires spending $200,000 initially but annual maintenance is required. Those maintenance cost vary from year to year due to re-seeding and fertilization requirements. Assuming a discount rate of 5%, the cost, discount factors (DF), and present values (PV) are summarized for the natural turf below. The NPV of the natural turf is $506,986.05 making it more expensive than the artificial turf. Note though that the NPV is very sensitive to the discount rate chosen. For example, in the case of the football field, a discount rate of 6% makes the artificial turf the cheaper option. Year Cost DF PV 0 200 1.000000 200.00000 1 30 1.060000 28.30189 2 50 1.123600 44.49982 3 30 1.191016 25.18858 4 50 1.262477 39.60468 5 30 1.338226 22.41775 6 50 1.418519 35.24803 7 30 1.503630 19.95171 8 50 1.593848 31.37062 9 30 1.689479 17.75695 10 50 1.790848 27.91974 Due to the sensitivity of the NPV with regard to the discount rate, the internal rate of return (IRR) may calculated as an alternative. The IRR calculates the discount rate that would cause the present value of benefits (returns) to equal the present value of costs. In the case of the NPV, the IRR is calculated such that \\(NPV=0\\). In the case of the football field, the IRR calculation yields to a discount rate which makes the natural turf identical to the artificial turf. The IRR (numerically) calculates \\(r\\) such that: \\[C_0=\\frac{N_1}{1+r}+\\frac{N_2}{(1+r)^2}+\\cdots+\\frac{N_t}{(1+r)^t}\\] where \\(C_0\\) is the initial cost and \\(N_t\\) is the return in time period \\(t\\). Note that you need a computer to calculate the IRR. In Excel, it is the function IRR. In the case of the football field, the discount rate of 5.47% makes the two investment options equal. To annualize capital cost, i.e., spreading the capital cost over the project life, we much calculate and use the annualization factor. \\[AF=\\frac{r}{(1+r)^n-1}+r\\] The annualization factor allows to distribute an initial lump sum over \\(n\\) years of life. The amount per period is such that when discounted, you get the initial capital costs "],["cost-benefit-analysis.html", "7.5 Cost Benefit Analysis", " 7.5 Cost Benefit Analysis Cost benefit analysis (CBA) is a systematic method to measure costs and benefits associated with a project. For private sector projects, private costs and benefits (i.e., those impacting the firms profitability) are considered whereas in the public sector, social costs and benefits (i.e., those impacting society) are incorporated. Non-monetary costs and benefits are often excluded in private CBA. The steps to conduct a CBA are the following: (1) Identification of objective and options, (2) identification of inputs and outputs, (3) valuation of inputs and outputs, and (4) calculation of net present value (NPV). For the first step, consider a city wanting to make commuting easier for its residents. The main objective may be to cut travel time but other potential objectives could be a reduction in air pollution and traffic congestion. The options for the city may be a commuter rail, expanded bus service, or expanded highways. Next, the inputs (cost) and outputs (benefits) need to be identified and expressed in physical quantities to ensure non-monetary items are not excluded from the analysis. In the previous sections on net present value, we did not explicitly present non-monetary objectives, inputs, and outputs but those almost always exists in the public sector. The valuation of monetary inputs and outputs is straightforward but is more difficult for non-monetary items. The valuation of non-monetary items can be done by calculating shadow prices, which represent the value of these inputs and outputs to the economy. For inputs, the shadow price is based on the marginal opportunity cost (i.e., the value of the input in its next best alternative use). For outputs, it is determined by the marginal willingness-to-pay (WTP), which reflects the value people place on receiving one additional unit of output. Lastly, the net present value is calculated and a project is rejected if the \\(NPV&lt;0\\) and accepted if the \\(NPV&gt;0\\). In the case of mutually exclusive projects, the project with the highest NPV is chosen. Other criteria are a benefit-to-cost-ratio (BCR), which needs to be above 1 or a internal rate of return (IRR) that is higher than the interest rate.

The initial investment is $500,000 and the revenue from selling the cloud-based storage is expected to generate the following cash flows over the next four years: $150,000 (year 1), $200,000 (year 2), $250,000 (year 3), and $300,000 (year 4). The interest rate is 8%. However, there is a potential regulatory change that could increase the cost of capital to 10% starting in year 3. To account for this uncertainty, you are required to calculate the NPV under two scenarios: (1) The interest rate remains constant at 8% throughout the project’s life and (2) the interest rate changes to 10% starting in year 3 (i.e., 8% for year 1 and 2, 10% for year 3 and 4). Show your work in a way that demonstrates your understanding of the NPV formula and the effect of changing discount rates on cash flow projections. Based on your calculations, recommend whether the company should proceed with the project under each scenario. Community Development Project (***): A non-profit organization is considering a community development project that requires an upfront investment of $300,000. The project is expected to generate the following cash flows over the next five years: $50,000 (year 1), $70,000 (year 2), $90,000 (year 3), $100,000 (year 4), and $120,000 (year 5). However, due to the project’s nature, there are significant uncertainties around the timing and size of the cash flows. If the project is delayed, each cash flow will be received a year later, and the amount for each year might decrease by 10%. Given those uncertainties, you are asked to calculate the Internal Rate of Return (IRR) under two scenarios: (1) The cash flows are received as listed without delay and (2) the project is delayed by one year, and each cash flow decreases by 10%. Compare the IRRs of both scenarios and recommend whether the non-profit should proceed with the project under either condition. Discuss why the IRR may be a useful decision-making tool in this context, considering the project’s uncertainties. Municipal Road Maintenance Investment (***): A municipality is evaluating two alternative projects for road maintenance, each with different initial costs and lifespans. Project A requires an initial investment of $1,200,000 and has a lifespan of 8 years. Project B requires an initial investment of $800,000 and has a lifespan of 5 years. Both projects are expected to provide equivalent service levels, but the municipality has a limited budget and needs to determine which project offers the better value over time. The discount rate for both projects is 6%. You are helping the municipality by calculating the annualization factor (AF) for each project in order to compare their costs on an annualized basis. In a first step, calculate the AF for both projects. Next, use the AF to calculate the equivalent annual cost for each project. Now, suppose that unforeseen circumstances lead to project A’s lifespan being extended by 2 years (making it 10 years) without an additional initial investment, and project B’s lifespan being shortened by 1 year (making it 4 years). Recalculate the AF and EAC under these new conditions, and explain the implications of these changes for the municipality’s decision-making process. Show all steps in calculating the annualization factor, including how you derived it using the present value of annuities formula. Clearly outline your reasoning for determining the EAC, and describe how changes in the lifespan of a project affect its annualized cost, making specific reference to the trade-offs between lifespan and upfront investment.

Dena, Eric, and Cullen are its founders and current directors and believe that nutritious food choices are part of a healthy lifestyle. They have three restaurant locations: North, East, and South. At all three locations and every day, those restaurants serve meals including a small appetizer and a dessert. They are considering opening a fourth location (West) and need to construct a personnel budget comprised of cooks and servers. The fourth location is projected to serve 300 meals per day. Here is a list of information they have compiled from the other locations Worker Productivity: One cook can prepare 140 meals per day. One server can handle 105 customers per day. Work Time: Each employee works five days a week. Wage: Cooks earn $34 per hour and servers earn $19 per hour. Fringe Benefits: The fringe benefits (i.e., retirement contribution, Social Security, and unemployment insurance) amount to 21.2% of the total salary cost. In addition, the cost for health insurance amounts to $100 per employee per month. Weekend Bonus: Since the restaurant will be open every day, Farm-to-Table 4 All will need to pay a salary bonus of 25% for work during the weekend. Vacation Time: All employees have ten paid vacation days. Provide the three founders with a detailed personnel budget to deliver 300 meals a day and given the above parameters. The expenses need to be calculated for a year, i.e., it will be an annual budget. The following components should be included in the budget (separated by cooks and servers): Workload calculations and personnel needed: In a first step, calculate the meals served per year, which is straight forward. Next, calculate the work (in days per year) that can be delivered by the cooks and servers. This allows you to calculate the number of cooks and servers you need (round up). Base salary budget: Calculate the hours per year that cooks and servers are working. This calculation is necessary since the wage is given in $ per hour. Make sure to include the vacation days as well. Weekend salary budget: Calculate how many employees you need on weekends and how much you have to pay them just for working on the weekend. Total budget: In a last step, combine the numbers of the base and weekend salary and add the fringe benefits. This final step should give you the total personnel budget. The three founders asked you to keep the budget flexible to assess the effects of key parameters on the cost. Specifically, they are interested how the following situations affect the bottom line: Increase in the hourly wage by 15% for both cooks and servers. This may be necessary to overcome the labor shortage. Decrease in the number of meals served to 250 due to higher prices and consumers decreasing their restaurant visits. "],["state-tax-refrom.html", "8.2 State Tax Refrom", " 8.2 State Tax Refrom You were just elected state governor. The central promise of your election campaign was to reform the state’s tax system to make it more progressive. There are ten households in your state and each spends their money on three items: Gasoline, food, and other goods. There are large variations of income and spending patterns across the three categories in your state. Let \\(M\\) represent the income of the household. The prices for gasoline, food, and other goods are \\(P_{GAS}\\), \\(P_{FOOD}\\), \\(P_{OTHER}\\), respectively. The quantity demanded (i.e., Q_{GAS}, Q_{Food}, and Q_{OTHER}) of each households depends on the demand parameters \\(\\alpha_{GAS}\\), \\(\\alpha_{FOOD}\\), and \\(\\alpha_{OTHER}\\). The demand functions can be written as follows. \\[Q_{GAS}=\\frac{\\alpha_{GAS}}{\\alpha_{GAS}+\\alpha_{FOOD}+\\alpha_{OTHER}}\\cdot \\frac{M}{P_{GAS}}\\] \\[Q_{FOOD}=\\frac{\\alpha_{FOOD}}{\\alpha_{GAS}+\\alpha_{FOOD}+\\alpha_{OTHER}}\\cdot \\frac{M}{P_{FOOD}}\\] \\[Q_{OTHER}=\\frac{\\alpha_{OTHER}}{\\alpha_{GAS}+\\alpha_{FOOD}+\\alpha_{OTHER}}\\cdot \\frac{M}{P_{OTHER}}\\] Besides the demand functions, the following information characterize your state’s tax system: State income tax rate measured in % of household income State sales tax rate (in %) added to the price of food and other goods. The sales tax is is not applied to gasoline. Gasoline tax in dollars per unit of quantity demanded. You can obtain the retail prices (relevant for the demand equations) by applying the taxes to the wholesale prices. Before considering any options to reform the tax system, you must calculate the current tax expenditures and effective tax rates to obtain a baseline. You are considering various options to reform the tax system to make the overall taxes more progressive: Exempting food purchases from the sales tax and uniformly (i.e., for all incomes) raising the income tax Exempting food purchases from the sales tax and increasing the income tax for households above a certain threshold Lowering the gasoline tax and uniformly (i.e., for all incomes) raising the income tax There are certain constraints associated with all those scenarios. You cannot change the sales tax rate and gasoline tax by household. Those taxes have to be changed for all households. The revenue generated across all four tax revenue streams cannot decrease. That is, the state is providing services that are paid for by the tax revenue. Since you are a politician and are already thinking about re-election, the case study should include the number of people who are better and worse off under the various regimes. The write-up of the case study should evaluate the baseline and three scenarios in terms of progressiveness of the tax as well as impact on the households compared to the baseline.
