A large emphasize in the chapter is on the purpose of taxation and government intervention in the economy. Topics such as externalities, public goods, and imperfect competition are covered that all justify government’s role in the economy. Basics of Budget Preparation Budgeting in the United States: This chapter covers aspects of Federal, state, and local budgets specific to the United States. Budget Methods and Format Cost Analysis: To prepare a budget, institutions need to know the cost associated with service provision. This chapter covers cost accounting and estimation as well as cost allocation. Capital Budgeting: Purchasing assets that are used multiple years (e.g., bridges, public school buildings, infrastructure in general) require assessment of future cost and benefits, which are covered in this section. Introduction to Government Revenue: Compared to the previous chapters, which focus on the expenditure side of government activities, this chapter introduce the revenue side. General aspects of taxation such as equity, adequacy of revenue production, collectability, and economic effects are covered. Income Taxes: Individual and corporate income taxes Taxes on Goods and Services: Sales taxes, gasoline and diesel taxes, etc. Property Taxes: The majority of revenue for local governments to be spent on education or public safety comes from property taxes. Other Revenue Sources: There are also other revenue sources such as fees and state lotteries. Fees are for publicly provided services (e.g., driver’s license) Debt Management Revenue Forecasting and Estimation "],["role-of-government-in-the-economy.html", "2.2 Role of Government in the Economy", " 2.2 Role of Government in the Economy Public finance is concerned with the role of government in the economy. The field addresses questions such as the following: Why do governments intervene in the economy? How do governments intervene in the economy? What are the economic effects of government intervention? "],["exercises.html", "2.3 Exercises", " 2.3 Exercises Government Intervention (*): There are various reasons why governments intervene in the economy. Describe three reasons that justify government’s role in the economy. Each reason must include a definition of the concept and a discussion of why the government is required to address the identified problem. Businesses and Education (*): Private businesses have a great interest in quality primary and secondary education because today’s students are tomorrow’s employees. However, private businesses make limited financial contributions to this sector of education (excluding the taxes they pay to public school systems) even to market-oriented programs like vouchers and charter schools. What kind of good is primary and secondary education? Identify the characteristics of the good you identified in part (a) and explain how primary and secondary education satisfies these characteristics. Given your response to parts (a) and (b) above, does it surprise you that private firms contribute so little to primary and secondary education? Explain? Smoking (*): One rationale for imposing taxes on cigarette consumption is that smokers impose negative externalities on the rest of society for example through secondhand smoking. In the absence of taxation, will people tend to consume too much, too little, or the right amount of cigarettes? Public Good (*): A community project (a public good) will cost $2,500 and will benefit the five residents of the community as indicated in the table below. Answer the following question: Are the benefits of this project bigger than the costs? Would the project be approved by a majority at a referendum? Does the project meet the Pareto Criterion? Does the project meet the Kaldor-Hicks Criterion? Resident Individual Benefit Cost Share A 800 500 B 800 500 C 300 500 D 350 500 E 450 500 Total 2700 2500 Fishing (*): There are various indications that the fish population in some fisheries is declining (see for example Are cod ‘severely depleted’ in the Gulf of Maine? Why fishermen, scientists view ocean depths differently. To stop the depletion, fishing bans have been imposed in various regions globally (Frank et al., 2005). Explain the problem associated with fishing in the context of excludability and rivalry in consumption. Agency Budget I (***): This exercise involves learning to read and use information in public budgets. As part of this assignment you will be looking at a budget of an U.S. federal agency. First, pick an agency (do not pick a state) from A-Z index of U.S. government departments and agencies and make sure that the agency publishes a budget online. Download the budgeting information of the agency. Review the agency’s budget and answer the questions below. Note that every budget will not provide sufficient information to answer all of these questions. If the information is not available, you should note this in your answers. What is the mission of this agency? What are the major programs carried out by this agency? What is the percent increase in total requested expenditures for the next year over the last year’s budget? What object of expenditure category is the largest? Which is growing the fastest? Is the number of personnel (full-time equivalent also known as FTE) in the agency growing, and is the growth rate faster or slower than the personnel budget (in dollars)? What does this tell you about changes in average salaries? What information does this budget give you on the productivity and performance of this agency? What information would you like to have to be able to assess the ‘efficiency’ and ‘effectiveness’ of this agency? Real vs. Nominal Income (*): Assume that your income in year 1 is $200 and that the prices of raspberries and orange juice are $20 and $10, respectively. In year 2, the prices of raspberries and orange juice are $22 and $11, respectively. Assume that you fully exhausted your income in both years to purchase raspberries and orange juice and that you purchase the same quantities of those items in both years. Did your income increase if you earned $210 in year 2? Distinguish between real and nominal income. How much money do you need to earn in year 2 to have the same real income in both years?

Federal Budget Deficit (***): Read the August 2018 report from the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) which is titled The Deficit Reductions Necessary to Meet Various Targets for Federal Debt. Note that the table of content indicates a “Summary” which contains most of the answers to the following questions: What is the difference between constant-share scenarios and growing-share scenarios? What are the effects on income per person (Gross National Product or GNP per person in the report) from reducing the deficit under various scenarios? Reducing the federal deficit can be accomplished by either increasing taxes or decreasing spending. What do you think are some of the economic, demographic, and political difficulties that arise while deciding which deficit-reducing policy to implement? How has the COVID-19 pandemic and its associated change in the economic and fiscal environment changed the projections outlined in the report. Mandatory versus Discretionary Spending (*): Why does only about 30% of all federal spending go through the annual appropriation process? Has that always been the case or were there periods where more than 30% of spending needed to go through appropriation? If yes, why has it changed over time? State Budgets (**): Pick a state of your choice (not Indiana) and identify key elements (listed below) of your state’s budget process and budget. The National Association of State Budget Officers (NASBO) provides much of this information in its publication Budget Processes in the States. Does your state have an annual or biennial budget? Which functions does the budget agency execute in your state? E.g, economic analysis, audits? What veto power, if any, does the governor have? How many votes does it take to override the governor’s veto? Is the state’s budget easily accessible on a state run website?

Dena, Eric, and Cullen are its founders and current directors and believe that nutritious food choices are part of a healthy lifestyle. They have three restaurant locations: North, East, and South. At all three locations and every day, those restaurants serve meals including a small appetizer and a dessert. They are considering opening a fourth location (West) and need to construct a personnel budget comprised of cooks and servers. The fourth location is projected to serve 300 meals per day. Here is a list of information they have compiled from the other locations Worker Productivity: One cook can prepare 140 meals per day. One server can handle 105 customers per day. Work Time: Each employee works five days a week. Wage: Cooks earn $34 per hour and servers earn $19 per hour. Fringe Benefits: The fringe benefits (i.e., retirement contribution, Social Security, and unemployment insurance) amount to 21.2% of the total salary cost. In addition, the cost for health insurance amounts to $100 per employee per month. Weekend Bonus: Since the restaurant will be open every day, Farm-to-Table 4 All will need to pay a salary bonus of 25% for work during the weekend. Vacation Time: All employees have ten paid vacation days. Provide the three founders with a detailed personnel budget to deliver 300 meals a day and given the above parameters. The expenses need to be calculated for a year, i.e., it will be an annual budget. The following components should be included in the budget (separated by cooks and servers): Workload calculations and personnel needed: In a first step, calculate the meals served per year, which is straight forward. Next, calculate the work (in days per year) that can be delivered by the cooks and servers. This allows you to calculate the number of cooks and servers you need (round up). Base salary budget: Calculate the hours per year that cooks and servers are working. This calculation is necessary since the wage is given in $ per hour. Make sure to include the vacation days as well. Weekend salary budget: Calculate how many employees you need on weekends and how much you have to pay them just for working on the weekend. Total budget: In a last step, combine the numbers of the base and weekend salary and add the fringe benefits. This final step should give you the total personnel budget. The three founders asked you to keep the budget flexible to assess the effects of key parameters on the cost. Specifically, they are interested how the following situations affect the bottom line: Increase in the hourly wage by 15% for both cooks and servers. This may be necessary to overcome the labor shortage. Decrease in the number of meals served to 250 due to higher prices and consumers decreasing their restaurant visits. "],["state-tax-refrom.html", "6.2 State Tax Refrom", " 6.2 State Tax Refrom You were just elected state governor. The central promise of your election campaign was to reform the state’s tax system to make it more progressive. There are ten households in your state and each spends their money on three items: Gasoline, food, and other goods. There are large variations of income and spending patterns across the three categories in your state. Let \\(M\\) represent the income of the household. The prices for gasoline, food, and other goods are \\(P_{GAS}\\), \\(P_{FOOD}\\), \\(P_{OTHER}\\), respectively. The quantity demanded (i.e., Q_{GAS}, Q_{Food}, and Q_{OTHER}) of each households depends on the demand parameters \\(\\alpha_{GAS}\\), \\(\\alpha_{FOOD}\\), and \\(\\alpha_{OTHER}\\). The demand functions can be written as follows. \\[Q_{GAS}=\\frac{\\alpha_{GAS}}{\\alpha_{GAS}+\\alpha_{FOOD}+\\alpha_{OTHER}}\\cdot \\frac{M}{P_{GAS}}\\] \\[Q_{FOOD}=\\frac{\\alpha_{FOOD}}{\\alpha_{GAS}+\\alpha_{FOOD}+\\alpha_{OTHER}}\\cdot \\frac{M}{P_{FOOD}}\\] \\[Q_{OTHER}=\\frac{\\alpha_{OTHER}}{\\alpha_{GAS}+\\alpha_{FOOD}+\\alpha_{OTHER}}\\cdot \\frac{M}{P_{OTHER}}\\] Besides the demand functions, the following information characterize your state’s tax system: State income tax rate measured in % of household income State sales tax rate (in %) added to the price of food and other goods. The sales tax is is not applied to gasoline. Gasoline tax in dollars per unit of quantity demanded. You can obtain the retail prices (relevant for the demand equations) by applying the taxes to the wholesale prices. Before considering any options to reform the tax system, you must calculate the current tax expenditures and effective tax rates to obtain a baseline. You are considering various options to reform the tax system to make the overall taxes more progressive: Exempting food purchases from the sales tax and uniformly (i.e., for all incomes) raising the income tax Exempting food purchases from the sales tax and increasing the income tax for households above a certain threshold Lowering the gasoline tax and uniformly (i.e., for all incomes) raising the income tax There are certain constraints associated with all those scenarios. You cannot change the sales tax rate and gasoline tax by household. Those taxes have to be changed for all households. The revenue generated across all four tax revenue streams cannot decrease. That is, the state is providing services that are paid for by the tax revenue. Since you are a politician and are already thinking about re-election, the case study should include the number of people who are better and worse off under the various regimes. The write-up of the case study should evaluate the baseline and three scenarios in terms of progressiveness of the tax as well as impact on the households compared to the baseline. Evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of all scenarios. "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
