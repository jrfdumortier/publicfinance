## Budget Philosophy
Budgets can be centered around (1) inputs, (2) outputs, or (3) outcomes.

## Line Item Budget
Characteristics

- Expenditure by commodity or resource purchased
- General cost categories are personnel services, operating expenditures, and capital outlays
- Control and accountability are main foci
- Input orientation and no input substitution (related this to economics and the production function). 
- No information about activities and functions

Primary organization feature

- Resources purchased

Orientation

- Control

## Program Budget
Characteristics

- Expenditure by activities serving a common public purpose
- Not limited to single government organization
- Common areas include: Public safety, public works (infrastructure, roads), human resources, general government
- Organize budget format and execution around service provision
- Programs with similar objectives are grouped together
- Disadvantage: 

     - Requires crosswalk
     - How to determine the programs (multiple competing objectives)

Primary organization feature

- Achievements, final product, outcome, or consumer output

Orientation:

- Planning
