# Consumption Taxes

Consumption Taxes
•	Various consumption taxes	
o	General sales tax (like in Indiana) and in many states: Tax levied on all consumption items. Certain items are excluded such as food and services. 
o	Excise tax: Tax on a specific commodity, e.g., tobacco, alcohol, gasoline, diesel. 
•	Taxes differentiated by stage of production (e.g., resource supply, manufacturers, wholesale, retail
•	Retail tax (e.g., sales tax) is implemented at the last stage
•	Value-added tax (VAT) is implemented at each stage and only the value-added is taxes. 
•	Understand the advantages of the VAT tax
o	Multiple actors along the stages of production are reporting the tax payment to the government in order to get reimbursed. 
o	Since the VAT is a self-enforcing tax (due to the reporting at multiple stages), tax rates are significantly higher (15% and above) than under a general sales tax. 
•	On the exam, there will probably be a question about sales tax and its effect on income distribution similar to the questions 1 and 2 on the last homework. Again, no calculations will be required but the ability to interpret the effects. 

## Exercises

1. ***Consumption Taxes in Europe vs. the United States*** (\*\*\*): Value-added tax (VAT) rates are higher in Europe than the sales taxes in the United States. The reason is that VAT are considered to be self-enforcing. Explain what self-enforcing means in the context of VAT.

2. ***RST vs. VAT*** (\*\*\*): You are the adviser to the state governor who considers the adoption of either a retail sales tax (RST) or a value added tax (VAT). The tax rate will be 9% in any case. For simplicity, assume that we have three production stages. The farmers harvest the wheat and sells it for \$100 to the miller. The miller produces flour and sells it for \$250 to the baker. The baker produces bread, which is sold at $500 to consumers. What is the tax remittance to the state government at each stage for the RST and the VAT. What is the total tax revenue to the state government.
